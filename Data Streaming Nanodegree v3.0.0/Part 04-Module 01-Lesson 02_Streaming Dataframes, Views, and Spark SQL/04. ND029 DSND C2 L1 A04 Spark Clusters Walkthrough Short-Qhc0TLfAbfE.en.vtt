00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
The first thing I'm going to do is make sure that Kafka and Spark are running.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.410
I'm going to type ps-ef, and sure enough,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.530
I see two processes running Spark,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.270
and I have several Java processes which tells me Kafka is up and running.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.030
Now that I have my solution written,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.665
let's go over that together.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:23.970
The first thing I'm going to do is create a file handle for my test file.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.620
I'm going to create a Spark session,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.510
set my log level to one,

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.175
and then I'm going to read in the log data using the Spark session.

00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:35.480
Now I'm going to filter my log data and

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.480
count the rows that have the letter D and the rows

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.330
that have the letter S. I'm going to put some markers in

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.465
that make it easier for me to see the data as I scrolls past,

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:47.810
and I'm going to show the actual line number counts.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.700
Then I'm going do spark.stop,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.730
which will actually quit the Spark application for me.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.270
I have a script written that runs this and it's in my folder here called spark,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.725
so its home workspace spark, like this.

00:01:04.725 --> 00:01:06.720
Then if I ls,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.180
I see a submit.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.269
In this case, I'm actually going to run it just manually,

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:17.515
so I'm going to go like this,

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:22.245
data spark bin spark-submit,

00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:30.660
home workspace spark, hellospark.py if you're using your script name.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.000
Mine is called.solution.py.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.610
Home workspace hellospark.solution.py,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.305
and including all of the libraries and starting to Spark application.

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:51.860
When we see a blinking cursor, we know we're running.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.970
There's my output, two lines with D and two lines with S.

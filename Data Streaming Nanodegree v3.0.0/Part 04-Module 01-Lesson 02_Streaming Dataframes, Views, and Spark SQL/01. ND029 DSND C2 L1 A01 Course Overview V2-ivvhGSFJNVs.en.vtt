00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.305
Hello and welcome to the first lesson of the Apache Spark Streaming course.

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:07.275
This lesson covers Spark Streaming DataFrames.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:09.450
Let's look at the course overview,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.360
we're at the beginning, Streaming DataFrames.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.470
In this lesson, we'll set the foundations of this course by getting hands

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.805
on by starting a Spark Cluster and deploying a Spark application,

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:23.130
creating a Spark Streaming DataFrame with

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.465
a Kafka source creating and querying a spark view.

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:29.875
Upon completion of lesson one,

00:00:29.875 --> 00:00:33.610
you should be able to successfully carry out the following tasks;

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.305
start a Spark Cluster and deploy a Spark application,

00:00:37.305 --> 00:00:41.130
create a Spark Streaming DataFrame with a Kafka Source,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.870
create a Spark view,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.250
query a Spark view.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.235
You were asked in the quiz question whether you would be able to be certain

00:00:05.235 --> 00:00:07.725
that the Spark cluster was up and running

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:10.830
if you received the correct output on the console.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.155
Well, let's take a look at the answer.

00:00:13.155 --> 00:00:15.420
The data showing on the console is

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.600
an indication your Spark application was written correctly.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.020
However, it is not a guarantee that you started the cluster.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.235
Running the Spark application without a cluster will not scale appropriately.

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:30.655
You should always check that the spark master and worker are running using this command.

00:00:30.655 --> 00:00:35.915
Typing ps -ef will give you a list of processes running on the server.

00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:39.545
You will want to watch for two lines that have the word Spark in them.

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:42.980
You may have to expand the terminal to see the full output.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.165
In this example, do you see Spark running?

00:00:46.165 --> 00:00:49.520
There are no processes showing the word Spark,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.350
so Spark is not running.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.480
How about in this example, is Spark running?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.535
Notice in this screen there are two lines containing the word Spark: each is a process,

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:03.050
one's running the master,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.610
and one is running a worker.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.710
This means Spark is actively running.

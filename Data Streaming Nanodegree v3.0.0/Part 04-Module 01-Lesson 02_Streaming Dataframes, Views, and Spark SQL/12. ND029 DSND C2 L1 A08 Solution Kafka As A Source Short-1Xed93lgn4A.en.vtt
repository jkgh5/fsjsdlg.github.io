00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
The first thing I'm going to do is make sure that Kafka is up and running.

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:05.280
If I do ps-ef,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.670
I don't see it, so I'm going to start Kafka.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.550
The next thing I'm going to do is start Spark.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.980
I'm going to say start-master.sh and copy the path to the log file.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.605
Start-slave.sh. I need to cut the log file and get the Spark master,

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:34.650
copy that URI, start-slave.sh and pass that URI.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.725
I think it's all ready running.

00:00:36.725 --> 00:00:43.910
I'm going to say data/spark/sbin, stop-slave.sh.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:54.740
Then I'm going to say home/workspace/spark/sbin/start-slave.sh and spark URI.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.830
Now, Spark is running and Kafka is running.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.845
Let's look at the solution.

00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:05.040
We are creating a Spark session,

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.810
we're creating a Spark application named balance-events.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.300
We're making the Spark log level "WARN".

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.205
We're reading from Kafka,

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:15.735
and we're reading from localhost 92.

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:18.330
That's our broker. Here's our topic.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.195
We're setting our offsets to earliest and we're loading.

00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:26.780
Now, we're going to convert the binary key and value from binary to strings,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.460
store that in a DataFrame,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.670
then we're going to write that DataFrame out to the console.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:38.620
I'm going to copy the syntax to start this from the script.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.770
I'm going to paste it in here,

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:48.270
and it's spark-submit --packages and then there's spark-sql-kafka JAR library,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:55.655
and it's now going to be important to specify the script for running and go Enter.

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:59.640
I'm just missing my leading slash.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.120
It's loading a bunch of JARs then it's starting Spark.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.330
Now, it's running the Spark program.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.405
We should see data from Kafka shortly.

00:02:12.405 --> 00:02:17.225
There's the keys with the account number for the balance event,

00:02:17.225 --> 00:02:21.000
and then the value is the actual balance.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.960
We're gong to Control C and quit that.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Let's recap the lesson so far.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.050
You should now be able to start a Spark cluster and run a Spark application.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.915
You should be able to create and work with Data Frames.

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:12.540
You should be able to read data from Kafka.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.240
You should also be able to create inquiry,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.510
a spark view, and write data to Kafka.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.045
Upon completion of lesson 1,

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:24.615
you should be able to successfully carry out the following tasks.

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:28.050
Start a Spark cluster and deploy Spark application.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.605
Create a Spark streaming Data Frame with a Kafka Source.

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:33.360
Create a spark view.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.545
Query a spark view. We just talked about streaming Data Frames.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:41.680
Next we're going to talk about Joins and JSON. I'll see you there.

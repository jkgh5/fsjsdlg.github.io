Congratulations on completing this course.

00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:07.320
In this class, we've taken a long journey through

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.425
the world of Kafka and its extensive ecosystem.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:15.330
We've also taken a look at stream processing tools like Faust and K SQL,

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.129
and seen how we can rapidly build stream processing applications with these tools.

00:00:20.129 --> 00:00:22.649
With the skills you've worked so hard to build in this class,

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.359
you're now ready to go and build cutting

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.539
edge applications that can offer insights in real time.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.089
I hope you've enjoyed this journey as much as I have.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.509
There are two options for creating streams in KSQL.

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:05.549
The first option is to simply define

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.384
the stream attributes and types with a create statement,

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:09.974
as you see on the screen.

00:00:09.974 --> 00:00:13.980
We always start by declaring the name of the stream we wish to declare.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.260
Here, we're using purchases.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.165
Next, in the parentheses,

00:00:18.164 --> 00:00:20.280
we declare the attributes or

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.585
the columns and the type that we expect for each one of those.

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:28.469
The final portion of the create statement is this width portion.

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:33.239
This provides additional information so the KSQL knows which Kafka topic to source from,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.340
and the value format simply describes

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.895
the serialization format of the data in the Kafka topic.

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:42.510
This can be one of Avro, JSON, or delimited.

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.394
Delimited basically just means that it's a CSV.

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:50.000
It's also possible to create a stream with a "select"

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.414
that excludes or modifies data from another preexisting stream.

00:00:55.414 --> 00:00:57.155
So you can see in this example,

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:02.689
we're creating a stream called purchases_high_value by selecting all of

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:05.480
the attributes from our purchases stream but only

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.600
where the amount is greater than 100,000.

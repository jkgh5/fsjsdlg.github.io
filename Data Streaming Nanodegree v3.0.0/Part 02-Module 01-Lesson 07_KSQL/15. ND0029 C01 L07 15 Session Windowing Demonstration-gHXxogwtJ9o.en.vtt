00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.005
Now, let's actually have a look at using Tumbling and Hopping in session windows.

00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:08.955
So returning to our workspace,

00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:11.664
we're going to go ahead and start by looking at creating a tumbling window.

00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:13.809
So we already have a purchases table

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.929
and a purchases stream which we're going to make use of.

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.539
So we're going to create a stream called,

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:26.934
purchases_tumbling, and we're going to select everything from our purchases stream.

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:33.375
But we're going to window it by let's actually do 10 seconds.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:35.429
So it elapses a little faster.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:38.265
So 10 seconds is a fairly short window,

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:41.829
but we'll be able to see the data roll through.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.824
So let's go ahead and let this run.

00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:49.105
Let's say "Select", and let the data come through.

00:00:49.104 --> 00:00:56.119
So you can see that really it just looks very similar to our normal purchases stream.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:01.019
But the data will roll over and there is one window information available to us.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.060
Next, let's take a look at a hopping window.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.870
As we saw in the lesson slides,

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.820
we basically defined a size and an advanced window.

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:13.024
So we're just going to grab this.

00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:15.635
We're going to work with a window of 30 seconds,

00:01:15.635 --> 00:01:18.240
advancing every five seconds.

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.929
We're going to create this hopping purchases window,

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.380
and then if we do show tables,

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:28.920
you'll see that we now have a purchases hopping table.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.625
Finally, let's take a look at how to define a session table,

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:36.305
with a session window.

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:43.550
So it's essentially the same syntax as creating a hopping or a tumbling window.

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.039
The difference is that, we simply specify how long a session is going to last.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.560
Now, five minutes is a long time,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.055
but you should see how this works by defining this.

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:56.540
So we're not going to actually see the session

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.425
expire within the context of this demonstration,

00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:02.869
but I just want to show you how quick it is to go ahead and create

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.870
a table with a session window of five minutes.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.045
So if you show tables,

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:12.844
we'll again see we have a session and a hopping window.

00:02:12.844 --> 00:02:18.099
If we do select username from

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:25.139
purchases hopping and let's just go ahead and,

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.954
excuse me, purchases session.

00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:29.835
Let's just limit this to five.

00:02:29.835 --> 00:02:32.305
First five usernames.

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:37.340
There you go. It's also worth noting that we only saw

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.310
B usernames because we've specified that username must start with B.

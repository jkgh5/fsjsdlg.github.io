00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:07.455
KSQL is a new and very exciting entering the stream processing space.

00:00:07.455 --> 00:00:10.289
Without writing any application logic whatsoever,

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.919
you can write SQL statements that KSQL can then use to transform

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.835
the data in your Kafka topics into stream processing applications.

00:00:17.835 --> 00:00:20.280
What's so wonderful about KSQL is that it allows

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.845
developers to use a SQL-like syntax that they're

00:00:22.844 --> 00:00:28.899
already very familiar with to quickly and easily create stream processing applications.

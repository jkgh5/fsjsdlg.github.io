00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
Using KSQL, we can transform our Kafka topics into streams and tables.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.919
Once we've turned these topics into either streams or tables,

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.495
we're free to use KSQL's SQL Syntax to perform many familiar operations.

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:15.059
For example, you can join or

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.045
aggregate these tables and streams once they've been created.

00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:21.390
Behind the scenes, the KSQL web server is translating your

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.289
SQL commands into a series of instantiated Kafka Streams.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.304
So a KSQL is transforming this command,

00:00:28.304 --> 00:00:33.369
your SQL command, into Kafka Stream applications.

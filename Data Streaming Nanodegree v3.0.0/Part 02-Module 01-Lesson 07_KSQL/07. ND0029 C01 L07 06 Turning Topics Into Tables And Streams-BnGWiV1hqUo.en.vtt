00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.059
Before we can actually use tables or streams in KSQL,

00:00:03.059 --> 00:00:09.765
we need to transform one or more existing input Kafka topic into a KSQL table stream.

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:13.140
First, we can ask KSQL to show us the topics that

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.440
it's aware of by using this "SHOW TOPICS" command.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.745
"SHOW TOPICS" simply displays all of the available topics on the broker.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:22.830
Once you've identified a topic we want to use,

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.304
we're ready to actually create a tabular stream.

00:00:25.304 --> 00:00:27.539
Before we move on and actually see how to

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.399
create tables and streams in the coming sections,

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.259
I want to note that just as in Faust,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.170
a Kafka topic always underlies the stream or tables that we actually create.

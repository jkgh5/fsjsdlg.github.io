00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.240
In this lesson, we'll learn about a SQL-like interface

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.855
for building stream processing applications called KSQL.

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:13.080
You'll see how you can use simple SQL statements to contract

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.024
complex stream processing applications just like we built Anfaust,

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:20.609
and run ad hoc queries to explore your streaming data sets.

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.050
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.475
you'll be ready to build and deploy

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:27.760
your very own stream processing applications on top of KSQL.

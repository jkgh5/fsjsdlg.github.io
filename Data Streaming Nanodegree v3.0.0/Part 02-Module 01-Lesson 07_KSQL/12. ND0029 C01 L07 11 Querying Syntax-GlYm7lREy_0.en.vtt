00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
Now that we've created a few tables and the streams,

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:04.919
it's time that we see how to query these streams

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:07.935
for information that might be useful for us to use.

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:11.820
The example on screen is a simple query that we might want to run to

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.554
find all purchases in US dollars that are more than 100,000.

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:16.829
If we wait long enough,

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.114
we'll eventually see records begin to return into a running query.

00:00:20.114 --> 00:00:21.704
Here's the catch though.

00:00:21.704 --> 00:00:24.584
If I "Control C" and exit this query while it's running,

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:26.685
the data's going to be lost forever.

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:30.814
The query is not persistent and does not continue to run in the background.

00:00:30.815 --> 00:00:35.450
This is a very important concept to understand with KSQL

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.995
if you want your streaming query to keep running and to be able to use that data,

00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:45.064
you need to use create table as or create stream as syntax.

00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:47.929
Otherwise, when your client session closes,

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:49.505
your data will be wiped out.

00:00:49.505 --> 00:00:52.850
So again, if I were to run this select statement,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.079
it would simply be printing it out the values that it's getting into my KSQL CLI,

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.045
it would just be informational for me to review.

00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:05.239
As soon as I hit "Control C" and exit out of the CLI,

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.530
that query stops running.

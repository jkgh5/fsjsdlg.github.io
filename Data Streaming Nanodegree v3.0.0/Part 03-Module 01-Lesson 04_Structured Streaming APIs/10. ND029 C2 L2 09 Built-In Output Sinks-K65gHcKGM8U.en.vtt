Structure Streaming uses sinks to add the output of each batch to a destination.

00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:08.279
Currently these are the following sink supported.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:13.109
File sinks, this stores the output to a file path you desire.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:17.669
Kafka sinks, this sends output back to one or more Kafka topics.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.995
Foreach and ForeachBatch sinks,

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:22.350
ForeachBatch is only available in Scala.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.804
Memory sinks, the output is stored to a in-memory table,

00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:29.039
this is mostly used for debugging.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.734
Console sinks, it's a standard output to console mostly use for debugging as well.

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:40.030
We'll primarily go over using the Console sink and File sink.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.839
One of the more commonly used APIs we'll be exploring is join.

00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:09.059
The concept of join will be very similar to the ones that we've used before in SQL.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.495
Inner, outer, left outer, right outer, etc.

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:17.114
But in streaming, we add another concept of streaming versus static DataFrames.

00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:20.744
This table shows what types of joins are supported.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:25.169
It's clear that inner join is supported,

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.425
whether it is a static or a streaming dataset.

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:32.174
When you use inner join on two streaming datasets,

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:35.234
you can use the concept of watermark.

00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:37.100
We'll discuss it in our joining of

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.310
two streaming data sets and water mark in a later section.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.679
A full outer join is not supported with a streaming dataset,

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:47.750
this is because there can be late arriving data.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.615
Let's say some even was generated at time x,

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:53.600
but the arrival to the application was actually y,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.295
because of these cases,

00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:57.575
and these cases do happen often,

00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:02.344
this could result in inconsistency in the output and produce undesired output.

00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:05.870
We also know sometimes outer joins produce null rows,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.480
and this could also create undesired output.

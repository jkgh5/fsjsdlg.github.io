00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
In this video, we'll go through query plans for aggregation.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.384
Aggregation is an execution planning strategy that spark planner uses.

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:11.429
Spark planner selects an aggregate physical operator

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.925
for an aggregate logical operator in a logical query plan.

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:18.285
It sounds a lot, but let's go through our code.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:23.899
Let's actually go back to the join query plan and we'll operate a aggregation there.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:28.029
So here we're going to aggregate on the region,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.225
by region column, and let's do a count on this,

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:35.460
then we'll do a explain.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.320
The group-by operator, groups the rows in a dataset by column.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.509
Then scan plan projects the columns in

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:47.854
need from the original RDD and loads them into unsafe row.

00:00:47.854 --> 00:00:50.404
So right here to FileScan.

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:55.490
Reversing the file scan parquet from the local saved the files like how we did before.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.140
So this comes from facilities,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.670
and this is a parquet,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.344
then we're only reading the Region: string.

00:01:05.344 --> 00:01:08.554
We also have this HashAggregate.

00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:11.720
It's essential to build a tungsten aggregation

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:15.754
iterator to process the aggregation for a given partition.

00:01:15.754 --> 00:01:18.784
Tungsten aggregation iterator operates directly on

00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:22.579
unsafe row to make aggregation faster and more efficient.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.429
After the aggregation by partition is done,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.585
exchange plans shuffles the data and the by keys.

00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:33.329
Here we chose region for our keys.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.044
Which of the output things are the most useful?

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:05.025
We have several options here.

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:07.515
Option 1, console, Option 2,

00:00:07.514 --> 00:00:10.259
memory, and Option 3, an actual file.

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.379
In real-world applications, anything that requires

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.390
streaming application receives anywhere from millions to trillions of records per day.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.410
Realistically, you'd want to save your output to some database.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.469
Usually, Hadoop file system, or on-premise,

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:28.529
or cloud storage so that you can always retrieve

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.204
your data and metadata due to the amount of data you will be getting.

00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:35.429
Saving anything to console or memory will be volatile.

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:38.840
In memory might be useful for a couple of hours or a day

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.080
at max but again this will eat up your resources and

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.244
you'll have to think about the cost to keep this in-memory table

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:49.719
alive and if it is ever useful to keep this in-memory table alive.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.030
You probably will need to create more than one table as well.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.149
The usefulness of output sync is to support

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.304
pipeline fault tolerance by saving output to a stable destination.

00:01:00.304 --> 00:01:03.070
Having console or memory is useful to debug,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.780
also to quickly view on sample amount of data,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.900
but to keep default tolerant,

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.180
make sure we save it out to a stable destination.

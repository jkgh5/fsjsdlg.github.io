In this lesson, we'll go over Spark streaming APIs.

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:08.834
Before doing so, we'll do a review on lazy evaluation,

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:11.700
transformation, and action functions in Spark.

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.539
We'll take a look at both Spark streaming and structured streaming which is

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.785
supported onward from version 2.2.0 to present,

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:24.490
and we'll be mostly be using structured streaming throughout the course.

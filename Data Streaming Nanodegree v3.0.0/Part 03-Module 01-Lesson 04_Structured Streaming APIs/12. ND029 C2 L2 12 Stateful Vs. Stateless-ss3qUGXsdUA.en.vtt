00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.055
Let's review what state is.

00:00:02.055 --> 00:00:05.880
State means the intermediate data maintained between records.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.890
When we talk about stateful stream processing it means a state is

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.380
shared between events and past events can

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.695
affect the way current and future events are processed.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:22.140
You can easily think about aggregations like a total count of a key in given interval.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.734
For example, stateful systems should keep track of user sessions or windows like

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:31.364
aggregate events coming from the same window and perform counts

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:35.594
like counting the number of key values in every window and more.

00:00:35.594 --> 00:00:38.089
These metrics can be check pointed.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.069
In a stateless stream processing,

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:42.500
each event is processed independently.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.335
One of the advantages of this independence

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:48.350
is that the application can be easily scaled up.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.230
This is because a stream data can be processed by

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:54.619
multiple processors with the help of simple load balancing.

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.140
When there is higher throughput in the system,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.545
you can easily scale up and launch multiple processors.

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:04.790
The main difference between these two stream processing types is that you always

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.630
want to store the state when you're engaged in stateful stream processing.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.194
In this lesson, we learned about Spark streaming APIs,

00:00:03.194 --> 00:00:05.580
and we also did a review on lazy evaluation,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.129
transformation, and action functions in Spark.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.269
Now, you'll be able to tell the differences between transformations and actions.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.070
You've seen a brief example of

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.594
structure streaming application and how to analyze query plans.

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:22.359
Now you're ready to try different input sources for Spark structured streaming

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.530
My name is Jillian Kim.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.070
I'm a Senior Data Engineer at Williams Sonoma.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.530
Previously, I worked at Samsung, Spongecell, Change Healthcare.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.740
Mostly I've been building data pipelines that handle

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.890
batch or stream processing of incoming datas.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.925
I am currently using structured streaming at my job to ingest multiple streams of data,

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:31.475
for example, Kafka or RabbitMQ.

00:00:31.475 --> 00:00:33.740
I've also used AWS Kinesis,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.345
which is another popular one.

00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:39.380
I use these streaming applications to ingest multiple streams of

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.700
data and to produce some output that is meaningful to the business.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.250
Well, it's important because now everything is

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.030
data centric and a lot of the data is streaming data set.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.300
So it is important for you to learn these skills so that you can

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.480
stay competitive as a data engineer in the job market.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.540
We will primarily focus on using Spark structured streaming,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.020
but you can also apply the concept of streaming as well in using other libraries.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.570
Mostly you'll be learning about the concept of

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.175
streaming on top of using Spark structured streaming,

00:01:24.175 --> 00:01:30.065
and you will also learn how to integrate one of the most popular streaming format,

00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:34.650
which is Kafka, into your structure streaming application.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.300
You will have the skill set to apply to a data engineering job that focuses

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.430
on building data pipeline that builds a streaming application.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.120
The hiring managers look for if you can write a good software,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.490
on top of if you have understanding of how to build a data pipeline in general.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.560
They will also look for if you can write

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.080
a scalable code and if you can troubleshoot streaming applications,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.510
or just in general, if you can troubleshoot,

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.180
and also data warehousing skills.

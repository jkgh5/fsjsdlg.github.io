00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.299
My name is Ben Goldberg and I'm a staff engineer at SpotHero.

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:05.955
I work on our platform team where I help lead efforts

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:09.669
around application development and data engineering.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.599
The skills that we're going to learn about in this course are

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.135
the same skills that I use on a daily basis on my work.

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:24.179
Data streaming is core to most of the applications that we're

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.210
building at SpotHero and our latest generation applications.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.679
That's both in data engineering world and also on the web application side.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.085
Data streaming is what allows us to create high-quality,

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:39.240
fast-moving applications that scale the size of our business.

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:48.079
The skills that we're going to learn about in this class

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:50.420
including things like Apache Kafka,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.550
and KSQL, and Faust.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:57.409
These skills are super important in almost all data engineering organizations today.

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.394
The industry is rapidly moving towards a place where

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:03.725
stream processing is an important part of most workloads,

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:06.200
and the fact of the matter is most people don't have a lot of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.155
experience with it yet outside of the big companies in the industry.

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:13.640
So the tools that we're going to review are not only going to help you understand how

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.123
to do stream processing because it's interesting and a new concept to understand,

00:01:18.123 --> 00:01:23.164
but it's also going to make you very attractive to potential employers who are actually

00:01:23.165 --> 00:01:25.400
really seeking these skills out to

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.490
actually level up and upgrade their own data engineering teams.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.500
So after completing this course and the nano degree program,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.010
students will be able to take the skills they have and level up at their own job,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.990
or there'll be able to go on apply it to

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:47.809
data engineering jobs that require stream processing skills.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.390
So even if it doesn't require stream processing skills,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.439
you're going to know how to use Apache Kafka really well,

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.179
which is incredibly important tool in a data engineering industry.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.920
So what I would say is,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.810
you'll not only be able to apply to data engineering jobs

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.460
which require stream processing,

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.349
but the skills you'll learn here are also

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:06.644
increasingly important in just general web development.

00:02:06.644 --> 00:02:08.960
So if you're working on back-end servers and you want to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.780
use stream processing techniques this course is

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.270
also going to help you understand those concepts

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.850
and make those skills more applicable to your daily work.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.240
When people in the industry are looking to hire for data streaming jobs,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.790
they're looking for a couple of things.

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:32.134
First and foremost, they want to see that you have some experience with the tools.

00:02:32.134 --> 00:02:34.549
So they want to see that you know how to use Apache Kafka,

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.635
and they want to see that you know a tool like

00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:39.919
KSQL or one of the equivalent tools in that ecosystem.

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:43.849
In addition, it's also has to have some familiarity with the Kafka ecosystem in general.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:45.500
So things like Kafka Connect,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.245
and REST Proxy, and Schema Registry.

00:02:48.245 --> 00:02:50.314
Beyond just that understanding

00:02:50.314 --> 00:02:54.305
just the general concepts of stream processing is really important.

00:02:54.305 --> 00:02:59.180
So being able to sort of describe how stream processing differs from batch processing,

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.270
and how batch processing differs from stream processing,

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.070
and how the two are not the same as each other,

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.789
but also how they can be used together

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:11.764
in complimentary terms because they're not necessarily competing skills.

00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:16.879
I think the third and final thing is that once you have these data streaming skills,

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.129
and hopefully also have those batch processing skills,

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:21.620
you can actually go into

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.080
your organization and communicate strongly with those around you.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.094
So data engineering is interesting because

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:30.889
you're an engineer but you're typically working with people in the business.

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:33.000
So business analysts, or the marketing team,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.569
or even other engineers to try and provide them

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.555
information that makes them able to do their job better.

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:40.640
So to do that, you need to be able to just talk to

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.799
people and understand what they're actually looking to get,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.710
and vice versa be able to explain to them in

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.215
plain English why it is what you're doing matters.

00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:52.500
So I think those three skills with the tech skills,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.969
it's the conceptual skills,

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:55.319
and it's those communication skills.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.560
Those are the three things that a well-rounded candidate will

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.930
be able to show to any potential employer.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.480
So a typical day at work for me is largely

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.569
based around still doing some day-to-day coding,

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.564
but there's also a lot of design and

00:04:15.564 --> 00:04:18.579
architecture put into the work that I'm doing on a daily basis.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.139
So I'm thinking about how can I use stream processing tools to make it to

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.289
that SpotHero where I work can make our applications more scalable,

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.260
and run faster, and respond to our client systems faster.

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.000
So that could be a web request,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.629
it could also be that we have someone in the business who has a data need and we

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:41.409
want to produce that insight to them faster than once an hour or once a day.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.550
Stream processing lets us actually give those results in real-time.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.590
So on a day-to-day basis,

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:50.379
I do spend a lot time thinking about how we can do that and helping educate

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:54.115
others in our company about how they can make that a possibility,

00:04:54.115 --> 00:04:59.689
but I also in day-to-day actually using these skills to build out those tools myself.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.170
I think the most rewarding thing about being

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.949
a data engineer and being able to actually apply these skills on

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.829
a day-to-day basis is the fact that you can see how it

00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:18.144
actually impacts other people's ability to successfully do their jobs.

00:05:18.144 --> 00:05:21.269
It can turn tasks that used to be difficult and arduous,

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:25.639
or imprecise into things that are easy for people to get done,

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:26.919
or they don't have to do it all anymore.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.350
So for example, there might have been somebody who used to handbill

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.040
that CSV or Excel spreadsheet that captured some sort of information,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.810
and it was their least favorite thing to do,

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.394
and it took them four hours every Friday.

00:05:38.394 --> 00:05:44.435
But instead we can write some code that not only does that on a continual basis,

00:05:44.435 --> 00:05:47.569
but actually frees this person up to not have to do this arduous,

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.420
repetitive work that they don't actually enjoy.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.580
So whenever I'm able to help someone out in

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:55.685
that regard and actually free them up to do what they enjoying what they're good at,

00:05:55.685 --> 00:05:58.920
I think that's really my favorite part of this job.

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.740
One of my favorite anecdotes are stories from SpotHero is when we

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.535
were still a tiny little startup and we had a team of five or six engineers,

00:06:13.535 --> 00:06:18.365
we would send up these sandboxes for us to test against in Digital Ocean.

00:06:18.365 --> 00:06:23.269
We'd use Amazon's Route 53 to give a DNS name to the sandboxes.

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:26.875
So you'd have Ben's cool sandbox,

00:06:26.875 --> 00:06:30.754
and then this sandbox environment domain name.

00:06:30.754 --> 00:06:37.574
So when we're done we would tear down the sandbox environment but sometimes we'd forget,

00:06:37.574 --> 00:06:39.319
we didn't have the whole thing automate so sometimes we'd

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:41.930
forget to get rid of this specific DNS entry.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.800
So if you forgot about that and then visited it like six months later,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.139
they'll point specific IP addresses.

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.810
So other companies would stand up machines in

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:56.089
their AWS accounts and we would end up pointing to their web servers.

00:06:56.089 --> 00:07:01.250
So one time I was working on I don't remember what the name of the sandbox was,

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.370
but I went to Ben's cool sandbox dot domain name,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:12.870
and it was like a start-up that was trying to sell machine learning sprinkler system,

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.949
and I just remember thinking, "Why is Ben's cool sandbox pointing to a machine?"

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:18.800
It took us a little while to figure out what's going on,

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.590
but we then discovered that we had a whole bunch of

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:27.064
other different DNS names that we're pointing to a bunch of random websites.

00:07:27.064 --> 00:07:29.810
I have to say that was a really entertaining days because we got to see all of

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.269
the things that we're supposed to be SpotHero.

00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:35.079
But they were actually machine-learning

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:39.259
sprinkler systems or whatever other random things that you can point to on the internet.

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:42.199
So that was a pretty entertaining day I have to say,

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:44.310
we found a lot of cool sites.

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:56.089
I think my favorite thing about the project for this course is the fact that you get to

00:07:56.089 --> 00:08:00.884
use all the tools that you've learned about in the actual course itself,

00:08:00.884 --> 00:08:04.310
but you're also going to get a taste for all the tools which you can expect to make

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:07.879
use of in your day-to-day as someone who's doing stream processing.

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:09.319
So you're going to touch Kafka Connect,

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:13.069
you're going to touch Kafka, you're going to touch REST Proxy, KSQL, and Faust.

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:14.733
You're going to do the production,

00:08:14.733 --> 00:08:18.435
and the consumption side of Kafka,

00:08:18.435 --> 00:08:23.089
and you're going to fill stream processing on top of that consumer-producer relationship.

00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:27.769
So it's fun and you're going to get to see how all of these tools get used.

00:08:27.769 --> 00:08:30.799
So once you're done with this project you'll be able to hopefully take

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.419
those skills and actually apply them to your own domain.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.490
So one of my favorite things about working with Udacity is that I

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.894
have the opportunity to teach not just a room full of people,

00:08:48.894 --> 00:08:50.184
or give a talk at a meet up,

00:08:50.184 --> 00:08:52.359
but actually reach a large audience of

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.909
people who are interested in the same thing as I am.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:59.048
So when I was first starting out in the space whether it's data engineering,

00:08:59.048 --> 00:09:00.990
or it's data streaming,

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.919
the amount of content that was out there,

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:05.209
it just really wasn't that big.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.180
So I didn't have the opportunity to have something like this.

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:10.089
So it's really exciting for me to be able to work with Udacity,

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:14.545
and actually increase the amount and quality of the content available in this area.

00:09:14.544 --> 00:09:16.309
Because these skills are super important,

00:09:16.309 --> 00:09:18.909
and it's really fun to work in stream processing.

00:09:18.909 --> 00:09:21.189
So I'm excited to have the opportunity to actually

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.680
work with Udacity to bring this content to all the students.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.490
I think the best thing about this course is

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.100
the fact that we're going to go over Kafka in so much detail.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.070
So even if you go through this course and you

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.325
don't get to use KSQL or stream processing tools right away,

00:09:42.325 --> 00:09:45.700
Kafka is such an important tool in our industry and is growing so

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.180
rapidly that that skill you're

00:09:48.179 --> 00:09:51.054
going to take it away and probably use it for years to come.

00:09:51.054 --> 00:09:54.250
So I think that's personally my favorite thing is that you're

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:58.250
going to get such a strong foundation in this really excellent tool.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.100
Student should take this course so that they can get

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.740
a strong foundation in Apache Kafka and its ecosystem.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:11.090
Which I always tell everybody it's

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.940
a super important tool in today's software engineering,

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.500
a tool-set generally speaking,

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.080
and it's only going to become more important I think over time.

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.000
I think it's also worth understanding

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.330
the concepts and fundamentals around stream processing.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:26.240
Even if you don't plan on taking those skills and using them at

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.149
your day job tomorrow or even six months from now,

00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:31.504
the industry is really headed in this direction.

00:10:31.504 --> 00:10:34.939
Our ability to react to real time data is critical,

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.020
and even understanding those concepts will help you better build your applications.

00:10:39.019 --> 00:10:41.419
Even if you're not able to take use of them right now,

00:10:41.419 --> 00:10:45.169
at some point in the future as your role or your company grows,

00:10:45.169 --> 00:10:49.829
there's a pretty good likelihood you're going to encounter these skills.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Forward compatibility indicates that

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.290
consumer code developed against the previous version of a schema,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.339
can consume data using the latest form of the schema.

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.830
Forward compatible changes include

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.580
the addition of new fields or the deletion of an optional field.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.445
Let's return to our purchase example once again.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:21.164
Recall the schema has the following fields: Username,

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:23.744
currency, amount, and an optional memo.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:25.890
If we were to delete the optional memo field,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.130
this would be a forward compatible change.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:32.609
Because the current code already has to handle the case,

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.814
in which the memo field may not be present,

00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:38.984
total removal of the memo field will not cause any processing issues.

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:43.435
Instead, the field will simply not be present in any new data going forward.

00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:46.810
Likewise, if we added a required field, say,

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.978
an area code to the newest schema,

00:00:48.978 --> 00:00:51.679
our existing consumer would simply ignore that field.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.464
As with backward compatibility,

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:57.340
forward compatibility has two types: Forward and forward transitive.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.360
Forward compatibility indicates the newest schema version

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.380
is compatible with the previous version,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.790
but not any versions prior to that.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.340
For transitive compatibility, indicates

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.180
the newest version is compatible with all prior versions,

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.870
not just the previous version.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.515
With forward compatible changes,

00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:15.170
you need to update producers to use

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.109
the latest version of the schema before updating your consumers.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.650
In this lesson, we learn why data schemas

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.140
are an important part of our stream processing workflow.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:10.904
We saw how unplanned changes can cause serious system failures.

00:00:10.904 --> 00:00:13.184
As we then saw, Apache Avro,

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:14.669
a conflict schema registry,

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.960
can be used to help ensure that schema changes occur smoothly and without error.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.500
We also learned how schema registry can help us clue in clients to

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.085
whether or not schema changes are compatible with its backward,

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:28.890
forward and full compatibility settings.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.914
The next lesson, we're going to see

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:35.579
how extended Apache Kafka Ecosystem tools like Kafka Connect,

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.329
and the REST Proxy can help us use Kafka in even more places.

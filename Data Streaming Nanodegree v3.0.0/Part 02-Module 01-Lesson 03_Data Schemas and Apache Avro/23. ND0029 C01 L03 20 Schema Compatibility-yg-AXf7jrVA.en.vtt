00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.495
When we say that we send an updated schema to schema registry,

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:06.330
we also send along a compatibility setting.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.810
This compatibility setting indicates to schema registry what

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.665
downstream consumers can expect when they start to consume new data.

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:17.564
What's great about this, is that as downstream consumers fetch data from Kafka,

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:21.690
the client code will also fetch the updated schema from schema registry.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.230
When scheme registry delivers the schema to the consumer client,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.660
clients can request compatibility information from

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.795
schema registry with a simple HTTP request.

00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:32.640
If the schema is compatible,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.420
the consumer can simply continue to pull data from Kafka.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.099
If the schema is not compatible,

00:00:39.098 --> 00:00:40.879
then the consumer will not pull the data from

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.700
Kafka until the consumer code has been updated.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.609
This process can help catch data changes early on,

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.865
and prevent expensive outages and missed process data.

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:52.594
It's worth noting that this process is not magic.

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:53.750
When you write producer code,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.820
you are responsible for telling schema registry

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.609
what kind of compatibility the change represents.

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.890
Additionally, your consumer code needs to

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.195
know how to fetch and handle these compatibility changes.

00:01:04.194 --> 00:01:07.674
Schema registry supports four categories of compatibility,

00:01:07.674 --> 00:01:11.530
backwards, forwards, full compatibility, and none.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.530
We'll review these categories in depth in the next few sections.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
Schema evolution is defined as the process of

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.804
changing the data schema for a given data set.

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:09.330
In practical terms, that means a Kafka producer has

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.875
modified the shape of the data as well as a data schema that it intends to send.

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:16.785
For example, we may be adding a field

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:20.640
or removing a field those would be types of schema evolution.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.640
Even making a field optional or changing the type

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.730
or meaning of an existing field as a form of schema evolution.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.190
To make a long story short,

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.140
if you're changing the format of your data in any way,

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.745
you're evolving your schema.

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:34.280
As we saw in an earlier exercise in this lesson,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.020
changes to an existing schema,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.460
any changes, have the potential to disrupt data consumers.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.259
Thankfully, schema registry and Avro can help us with

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:45.769
this process and practice evolving a scheme schema

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.950
simply means updating the arrow definition and resubmitting

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.340
the schema to schema registry with some compatibility information.

Data and software systems rarely remains static.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:09.269
As requirements change, so too will our schemas.

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.304
The process of schema change is referred to as Schema Evolution.

00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:16.530
Understanding how schemas evolve and how it will impact

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.385
our software is an important part of managing streaming data.

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:23.970
Schema registry provides explicit compatibility types to help

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:26.460
downstream consumers understand whether new data is

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.160
compatible or not as the schema evolves.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.020
Let's dive in to how this works.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.820
The final type of compatibility offered by Schema Registry is none compatibility.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.460
This type of compatibility could be used to

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.460
indicate a breaking change in our schema definition.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.929
For example, if we change the amount field in our purchase schema from int to float,

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.089
this is a change that does not satisfy a backward or forward compatibility changes.

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:25.824
Changing a field from int to float or int to string is a complete breaking change.

00:00:25.824 --> 00:00:28.125
The wrinkle here is that none,

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:30.899
tell Schema Registry to stop tracking changes.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.280
When you run into this kind of scenario,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.039
it's a best practice to start a new topic with your new schema,

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:40.159
rather than putting incompatible data into the new topic.

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.494
Not following this best practice will almost certainly break downstream consumers

00:00:44.494 --> 00:00:49.144
and result in messy consumer code to handle incompatible data within the same topic.

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:53.720
It's worth mentioning that not using schema registry to attract compatibility,

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.229
in a sense almost wipes out the benefit of using the tool.

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.529
So please avoid using this unless there's a really strong reason to.

00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:05.919
Streaming applications are highly dependent on data schemas.

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:08.769
Schemas are widely used in data streaming applications,

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.695
to codify the data being produced and received.

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:15.099
Because of the real-time nature of streaming applications and the

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.250
fact that these systems are consuming data from other applications,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.339
that may not even be aware of the streaming application exists,

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:25.704
schemas are absolutely critical for maintaining a functioning streaming application.

00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:28.719
Schemas allow for data producers to evolve largely

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:32.989
independently of a data consumers, namely streaming applications.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.065
In many organizations, the data engineers building a streaming applications,

00:00:37.064 --> 00:00:41.049
may not even interact with the developers building the producer applications at all.

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:43.829
Application developers may not be aware or

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.420
interested in the needs of the data engineering streaming applications.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.070
Given this dynamic, both data producers and the consuming streaming applications,

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.115
must be able to evolve independently without failure.

00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:57.740
This is critical for the organization's ability to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.400
scale and successfully utilize stream processing technology.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.939
Schemas provide the tool that stream processing applications

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.599
need to evolve independently of their upstream producers.

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:13.069
Schemas can help shield data consumers from unexpected changes in the system.

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:18.349
Some schema systems even provide detailed information about data compatibility to help

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:20.689
applications understand what they can or

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.689
cannot do with a given piece of data as it arrives.

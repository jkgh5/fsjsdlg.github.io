00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.825
In the previous lessons,

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:06.530
we've gotten a few glimpses of data schemas.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.199
Up until now, you've sent payloads to a streaming data store Kafka,

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.539
in string or JSON form.

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.599
As data flows through our stream processing applications,

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.449
it's critical for both consumers and producers to understand what data is expected.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.589
In this section, we'll highlight the benefits that data schemas can provide us,

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:29.079
and how they get used in real-world systems.

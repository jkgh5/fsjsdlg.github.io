00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.089
Now that we understand the benefits of data schemas generally,

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.195
we're going to dive in and take a look at Apache Avro.

00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:14.535
Apache Avro is one of the most popular data schemas in the data engineering space today,

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:18.269
and is especially heavily used in the Kafka ecosystem.

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.769
This won't be an exhaustive review of Avro and all of its features,

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.210
but you can expect to develop

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.050
a strong understanding of Avro's course syntax and concepts.

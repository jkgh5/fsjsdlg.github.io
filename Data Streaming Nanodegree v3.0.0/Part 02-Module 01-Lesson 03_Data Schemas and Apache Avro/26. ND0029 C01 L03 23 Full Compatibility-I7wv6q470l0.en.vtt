00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.280
By this point, you may be thinking that some changes can be

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.565
both forward and backward compatible, and you'd be right.

00:00:08.564 --> 00:00:11.640
This is where full compatibility comes into play.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.490
When we say that a change is fully compatible,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.300
it means that change is both forward and backward compatible.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.400
This means that consumers developed against

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:24.000
the latest schema can consume data using the previous schema.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.030
Likewise, it also means that consumers developed against

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.020
the previous schema can still consume data from the latest schema.

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.200
This type of schema change is most common when

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.325
changing the default value for a field that has a default value.

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:41.660
For example, let's say our purchases model had

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.859
an action field and the default value on that field was completed,

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.174
completed might denote that the purchase is finished.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:53.239
Later we could choose to update that default value on that field to something

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.200
like pending payment to indicate that every purchase has been created,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.840
but payment has not yet been received.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.980
This type of update which were simply changing the value of

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.685
the default field is a fully compatible change.

00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:10.210
With full compatibility changes,

00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:13.414
you can update either of the producer or consumer first,

00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:15.870
the order doesn't matter.

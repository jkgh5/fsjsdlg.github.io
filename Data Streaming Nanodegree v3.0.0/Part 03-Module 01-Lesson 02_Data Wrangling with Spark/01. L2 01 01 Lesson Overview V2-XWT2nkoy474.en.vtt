00:00:05.179 --> 00:00:07.349
In the last lesson,

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:10.640
you learned how Spark fits into the greater big data ecosystem,

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.030
and why Spark is central to this field.

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:17.204
Spark is built for large datasets that require distributed system

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:21.869
of multiple computers and is optimized to use memory efficiently.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.445
In this lesson, you will use Spark to get hands on experience wrangling data.

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:27.899
You will get familiar with

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:31.919
functional programming concepts that you will encounter everyday in Spark,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.115
such as maps, Lambda functions, and closures.

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:38.520
Then you will learn how to read in and write out data using

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.910
common formats such as CSV files and JSON.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:45.319
You will also get comfortable with the Spark environment and learn

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.768
how to wrangle data with the two most popular Spark KPIs,

00:00:48.768 --> 00:00:51.259
Spark DataFrames and Spark SQL.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.869
You will practice using the Sparks syntax on

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:58.384
smaller datasets before you start to scale to big data in lesson three.

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:02.750
Finally, we'll also touch on the low-level RDD API

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.120
which you'll run into from time to time,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.790
even when you're using the high level dataframe

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.820
and Spark SQL APIs. Now, let's dig in.

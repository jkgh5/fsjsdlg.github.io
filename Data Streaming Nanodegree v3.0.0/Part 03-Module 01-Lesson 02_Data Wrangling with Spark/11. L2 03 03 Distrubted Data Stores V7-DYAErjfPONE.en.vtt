00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.910
Then we have so much data that we need distributed computing.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.605
The data itself often needs to be stored in a distributed way as well.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:20.609
Distributed file systems, many storage services,

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.975
and distributed databases store data in a fault tolerant way.

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:28.440
So if a machine breaks or becomes unavailable,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.500
we don't lose the information we have collected.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.020
As we mentioned in the previous lesson,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.345
Hadoop has a Distributed File System,

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:38.634
HDFS, to store data.

00:00:38.634 --> 00:00:44.059
HDFS splits files inton64 or 128 megabyte blocks

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.060
and replicates these blocks across the cluster.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.390
This way, the data is stored in a fault tolerant way

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.674
and can be accessed in digestible chunks.

00:00:53.674 --> 00:00:56.629
If you don't want to maintain our own cluster,

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.700
we can use many services such as

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.290
the Amazon Simple Storage Service or S3 to store objects

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.920
entered to retrieve any random data from anywhere.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.090
Companies using AWS or Amazon Web Services

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.719
often use S3 to store the raw data they have collected.

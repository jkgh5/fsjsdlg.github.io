00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.070
We have talked about where to store huge data files

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.155
and what format the data might be in.

00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:16.664
So let's take a look at how Spark Program looks.

00:00:16.664 --> 00:00:21.149
The first component of each Spark Program is the SparkContext.

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.879
The SparkContext is the main entry point for

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:27.869
Spark functionality and connects the cluster with the application.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.975
If we would like to use lower level abstractions,

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:33.704
we will create objects with SparkContext.

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:35.579
To create a SparkContext,

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.519
we first need a SparkConf object to specify

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.620
some information aboutnthe application

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:44.929
such as its name and the master's nodes IP address.

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.119
If we run Spark in local mode,

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:50.809
we can just put the string 'local' as master.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.815
To read data frames, we need to use SparkContext,

00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:58.079
Spark Sequel equivalent, the SparkSession.

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.960
Similarity to the SparkConf,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.785
we can specify some parameters to create a SparkSession.

00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:08.810
GetOrCreate for example, means that if you already have a SparkSession running,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.670
instead of creating a new one,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.710
the old one will be returned and

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:16.919
its parameters will be modified to the new configurations.

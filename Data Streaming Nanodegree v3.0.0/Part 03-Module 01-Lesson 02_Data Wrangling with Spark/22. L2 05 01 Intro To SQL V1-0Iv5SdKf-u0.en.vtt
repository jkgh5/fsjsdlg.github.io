00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.599
You just saw how to analyze DataFrames with imperative programming.

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.484
Next, you'll learn to query data with a declarative approach.

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:17.429
Spark comes with a SQL library that lets you query DataFrames using

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:22.109
the same SQL syntax you'd use in a tool like MySQL or Postgres.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.280
There are quite a few benefits to working with Spark SQL,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.225
especially if you're already comfortable with the SQL language.

00:00:28.225 --> 00:00:31.970
Plus, you'll be able to share your Spark code with a wider community,

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.890
since many analysts and data scientists prefer using SQL.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.250
Also, Spark automatically optimizes your SQL code,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.729
to speed up the process of manipulating and retrieving data.

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:48.319
To follow you it's cake analogy, you simply tell your program to bake a cake,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.820
and Spark SQL will give you a great cake even if you don't detail the exact steps.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.609
Let's jump in.

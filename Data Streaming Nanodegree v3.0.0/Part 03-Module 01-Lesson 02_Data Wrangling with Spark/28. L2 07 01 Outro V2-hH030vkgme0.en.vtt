00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.445
We've covered quite a bit in this lesson.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:12.510
First, you've learned how to wrangle data with functional programming,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.785
and you saw this programming style helps us scale across distributed systems,

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:21.629
then you practice reading data into Spark, and writing data out.

00:00:21.629 --> 00:00:25.049
You also gained experience with the high level APIs,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.839
Spark DataFrames, and Spark SQL.

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.344
Like any programming language or tool,

00:00:30.344 --> 00:00:33.254
you won't master it without a fair amount of practice.

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:36.030
Now that you know how to wrangle data with Spark,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.120
go and find some datasets that you are interested in,

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:41.664
and start exploring them with Spark.

00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:44.200
Once you play with a few of these datasets,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.740
especially messy real-world data,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.760
you probably run into a few errors,

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:51.875
or cases where Spark runs particularly slowly.

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:56.570
Up to this point, we've focused on running Spark on smaller datasets,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.284
just to get you comfortable with the basic syntax.

00:00:59.284 --> 00:01:03.279
In the next lesson, we're going to talk about debugging your Spark code,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.469
and how to speed it up to work on true big data.

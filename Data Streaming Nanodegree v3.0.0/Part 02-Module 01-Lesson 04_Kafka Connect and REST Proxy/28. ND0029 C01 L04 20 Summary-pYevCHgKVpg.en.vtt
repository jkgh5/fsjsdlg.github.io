00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:06.549
In this lesson, we learned how Kafka Connect can help save us

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.059
time and effort in integrating Kafka into existing workflows.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.100
Whether you have a Postgres database,

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.709
data and a key-value store like S3 or simply log files on disk,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.870
Kafka Connect can help get data into and out of Kafka.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.304
Next, we saw how REST Proxy can allow us to integrate

00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:26.975
any application capable of HTTP with Kafka.

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:31.990
Rest Proxy provides an HTTP interface for fetching broker details and metadata,

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.439
in addition to producing and consuming to Kafka itself.

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:36.984
In the upcoming lessons,

00:00:36.984 --> 00:00:38.259
we're going to see how we can combine

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:41.589
the streaming data ingestion skills we've just learned in the previous lessons,

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.680
to build stream processing applications.

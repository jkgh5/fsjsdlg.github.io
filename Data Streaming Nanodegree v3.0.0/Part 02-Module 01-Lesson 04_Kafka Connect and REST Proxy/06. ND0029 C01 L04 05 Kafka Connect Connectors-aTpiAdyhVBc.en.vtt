00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.790
Kafka connects plug-in architecture has led to

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.445
the development of a strong catalog of open-source connectors.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:11.699
In this section, we will review some of the most useful connectors

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.869
available in the community and gain some experience in applying them to a data source.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.914
There are many types of Kafka connect plug-ins available today.

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:23.265
Most existing connector plug-ins are focused on data bases and data sources.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:25.664
Let's review some of the most common categories.

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:30.559
First, connectors plug-ins for local file source and local files sink.

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:35.149
These plug-ins are popular for moving logs into an out of Kafka.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.199
Cloud key value stores such as AWS, S3,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.415
or Google Cloud Storage are another key popular source or sync.

00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:50.089
Traditional SQL data bases such as MySQL or Postgres are also common and useful plug-ins.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.845
There are even plug-ins for working with HDFS data sources and rest APIs.

00:00:54.844 --> 00:00:58.475
Kafka maintains a website with a list of all available connectors.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:02.399

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.769
Now if at this point you get to this point in the exercise and you're having problems,

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:08.219
it's going to be worth knowing how to debug Kafka Connect.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.515
So I'm going to pretend like something broke.

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:13.050
I'm going to show you how to get into the Kafka Connect logs where it

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.990
will give you detailed information about why it's failing.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.740
So you're going to want to use the tail command and we'll use

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:23.639
dash f to follow and look at var/log.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.685
Then we're going to look into Kafka.

00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:30.489
Excuse me. We're going to look into journal/confluent-kafka-connect.service.log.

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:41.194
This is going to show us the logs from Kafka Connect.

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:43.850
This will be included in the notes for this section,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.050
so you don't need to memorize this.

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:48.964
But you can actually watch what Kafka Connect is up to by taking a look at its logs.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.680
So whether it's in this exercise or

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.259
it's in your project when you're working with Kafka Connect,

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:55.655
if you're having a problem,

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:59.570
the first place you should look after you've looked at the status URL is

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.605
to come into the logs and see if you can diagnose what the issue is.

00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:08.634
More often than not, it'll give you a descriptive failure message for you to work with.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:13.480
Finally, what's actually see that data is showing up in our topic.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.655
So again, we're going to use Kafka topics to list the available topics for us.

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:22.954
You'll simply have connect-purchases.

00:01:22.954 --> 00:01:26.914
This is the topic that was created to contain our JDBC source information.

00:01:26.915 --> 00:01:31.780
So we're going to do Kafka console consumer, bootstrap server,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.879
localhost 9092, the topic is connect to cash

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:39.259
purchases and we want to make sure we start from the beginning,

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.075
because we want to see all the data.

00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:46.650
If you look in here, we can see all the data from our database is now present.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.915
So as you can see, working with Kafka Connect,

00:01:49.915 --> 00:01:52.230
can save you quite a bit of time.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.889
In the previous lesson,

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:07.889
we've seen how to use specific Kafka Client Libraries to get data into and out of Kafka.

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:09.509
While these libraries are great,

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.649
it does take development time to actually integrate them into our applications.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.850
In this lesson, we're going to see two tools which can help

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.345
integrate Kafka into almost any application you can imagine.

00:00:20.344 --> 00:00:22.579
First, we're going to see Kafka Connect.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.494
Kafka Connect allows us to reuse existing components to

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:31.385
source data into Kafka and sync data out from Kafka into other databases.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:34.730
Likewise, we're going to see how to use Kafka REST Proxy to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:38.584
get data into and out of Kafka with HTTP.

00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:40.399
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.714
you'll have a whole slew of new options at your disposal,

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:45.870
to work with Kafka.

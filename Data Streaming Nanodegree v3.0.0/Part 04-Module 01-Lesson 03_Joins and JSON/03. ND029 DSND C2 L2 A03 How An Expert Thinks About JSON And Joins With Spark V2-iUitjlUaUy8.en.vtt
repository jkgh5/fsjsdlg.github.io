00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.995
What are some things you should think about when working with joins and JSON in Spark.

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.535
JSON is universally used to transmit data.

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:10.875
It is simple to read and write.

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:13.680
Almost any system will accept it.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.060
JSON format can be used to describe most record types.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.380
Joining streaming data is typically difficult.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.140
Usually joining streams of data is not straight forward.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.230
Without built-in streaming join functionality,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.315
you have to write code to cache or query and extract data.

00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:37.500
This can be very IO intensive because the data is often

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.309
stored in very large tables and may be difficult to index.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.550
The time to retrieve the secondary data is often prohibitive.

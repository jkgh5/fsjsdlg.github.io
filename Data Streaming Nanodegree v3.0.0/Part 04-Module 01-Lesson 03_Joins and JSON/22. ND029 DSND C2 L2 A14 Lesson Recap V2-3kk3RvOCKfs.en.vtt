00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Let's recap what you have done in this lesson.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.015
First, you worked with parsing a source JSON payload.

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:08.880
Then you joined two different streaming DataFrames.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.960
Then you created a Kafka sink with a newly created DataFrame.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.180
Now that you've completed lesson 2,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.255
you should be able to successfully complete the following.

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:22.020
Parse a JSON payload into separate fields for analysis.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.530
Join two streaming DataFrames from different data sources.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.385
Write a streaming DataFrame to Kafka with aggregated data.

00:00:29.385 --> 00:00:32.549
Now that you've learned about JSON and Joins,

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.460
we're now going to move onto Redis,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.010
Base64 and JSON. See there.

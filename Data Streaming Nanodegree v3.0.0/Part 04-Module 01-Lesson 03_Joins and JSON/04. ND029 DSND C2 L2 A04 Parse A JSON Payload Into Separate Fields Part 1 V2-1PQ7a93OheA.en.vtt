00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
Let's start by working with JSON Kafka messages as a Spark streaming source.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.070
We will first analyze the source sample.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.215
Next, we create a schema.

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:13.560
Last, we use the schema to extract fields.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.130
Let's start by analyzing the source sample.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.700
Creating a Sink can be compared with assembling a puzzle.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.520
The JSON Fields are the pieces to the puzzle.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.515
Just as the picture of the finished puzzle will help you decide where pieces belong,

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:33.040
seeing the end goal for your Sink format guides your programming.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.570
Let's take a look back in draw.i0 at where

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.775
our sources are coming from and where our sink will go.

00:00:40.775 --> 00:00:44.210
Let's look at this Spark application.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.540
We're going to start off with just a cylinder that

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.735
I've taken and dragged over and then turn sideways,

00:00:50.735 --> 00:00:54.070
and I'm going to use this to represent my topics.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.740
We're going to draw each of the topics that we're going to use in this lesson.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.175
I'm going to put some text on this topic,

00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:04.665
that way I can label it.

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:08.855
One of the topics we're going to look at is gear-position.

00:01:08.855 --> 00:01:13.835
I'm going to copy this topic by copying and pasting it.

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:18.920
Another topic we're going to work with is vehicle-status.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.935
Another topic that we're going to work with is vehicle check-in status.

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:27.920
Where are these topics coming from?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.650
You may have asked yourself that question when you worked in

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.430
the earlier exercises of Lesson 1.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.520
In our workspace, we have a Java application that's used for simulating data,

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.180
so I'm going to draw that.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.915
We're going omit Kafka as an entity from this diagram

00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:53.185
because each of these topics infers the presence of a Kafka broker,

00:01:53.185 --> 00:01:56.915
so this is where the data is actually coming from.

00:01:56.915 --> 00:02:02.795
The simulation application is actually populating each of these topics.

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:06.560
In order to do so, it has to connect to Kafka,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.420
and then provide a topic name.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.260
Then it writes the data into the topic.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.605
Where are we ingesting this data?

00:02:13.605 --> 00:02:15.915
We're ingesting it in a Spark application,

00:02:15.915 --> 00:02:17.265
so I'm going to draw that.

00:02:17.265 --> 00:02:19.905
I'm going to copy this simulation,

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:22.140
and bring it over here.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.030
My Spark application is the one ingesting these topics,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.450
so I'm going to represent that.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:35.330
Lastly, I'm going to create a Kafka topic that I'm sending data to,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.265
from my Spark application,

00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:40.960
and I've called that topic in my case,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.295
check-in status because it has data from vehicle-status and vehicle check-in,

00:02:47.295 --> 00:02:50.300
and it's joined data.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.670
So I'm calling it something that represents the names from both original topics.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.445
Which direction should the arrows go here?

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:00.530
Where should the data be coming from?

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.630
If it's originating in Spark,

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.990
then I should represent that,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.530
and where's the data going?

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.200
In theory, we would have an application consuming this data,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.605
so we can just say that our simulation is consuming it,

00:03:14.605 --> 00:03:17.930
and that shows us an example of a consumer.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.740
This has just been a simple exercise to draw where the data is coming from,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.430
and where it's going to in the ecosystem that you've been working in,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.070
and we'll continue to work in throughout the rest of the course.

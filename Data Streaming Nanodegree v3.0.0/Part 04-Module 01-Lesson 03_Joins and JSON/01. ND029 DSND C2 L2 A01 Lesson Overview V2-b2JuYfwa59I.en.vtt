00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.035
This is the second lesson of the Apache Spark streaming course.

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:06.720
This lesson covers Joins and JSON.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.715
Let's look at the course overview.

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:11.235
You just learned about streaming DataFrames.

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:13.950
In this lesson, we'll become familiar with parsing

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.505
a JSON payload into separate fields for analysis,

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:21.530
joining two streaming DataFrames from different data sources,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.775
and writing a streaming DataFrame to Kafka with aggregated data.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:28.040
Upon completion of Lesson 2,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.600
you should be able to successfully complete the following.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.740
Parse a JSON payload into separate fields for analysis,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.630
join two streaming DataFrames from different data sources,

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.000
and write a streaming DataFrame to Kafka with aggregated data.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.025
You were asked in the quiz how to start troubleshooting a non-working Spark application.

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:06.870
Let's take a look at the answer.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.410
It's very common that your Spark application will not run correctly the first time.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.775
The first step is usually to look for errors in the Spark console.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:16.155
If there aren't any errors,

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:17.655
but your data doesn't look right,

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:20.700
it might be time to start examining some of your data frames.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.530
To view the data frame in question,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.480
simply change the output of your Spark application to point to that data frame.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.490
In this case, we have two data frames,

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.115
one called customerSelectStarDF, and one called customerWithDepositDF.

00:00:35.115 --> 00:00:37.830
To examine data, pass the data frame to

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.430
the.writeStream call on the last line in this example.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.620
Notice we are now writing the data from

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.975
customerSelectStarDF instead of customerWithDepositDF to the console.

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:53.390
Once we start running the Spark application,

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.135
we will see the data that we want to look into further.

00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:58.820
This may lead to a conclusion about what we need

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.370
to change in dealing with that particular data.

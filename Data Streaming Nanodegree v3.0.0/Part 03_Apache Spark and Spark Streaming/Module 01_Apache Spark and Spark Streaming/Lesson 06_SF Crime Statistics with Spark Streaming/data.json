Choose \"Prebuilt for Apache Hadoop 2.7 and later.\"\n- Unpack Spark in one of your folders (I usually put all my dev requirements in /home/users/user/dev).\n- Download binary for Kafka from this location https://kafka.apache.org/downloads, with Scala 2.11, version 2.3.0. Unzip in your local directory where you unzipped your Spark binary as well. Exploring the Kafka folder, you’ll see the scripts to execute in `bin` folders, and config files under `config` folder. You’ll need to modify `zookeeper.properties` and `server.properties`.\n- Download Scala from the official site, or for Mac users, you can also use `brew install scala`, but make sure you download version 2.11.x.\n- Run below to verify correct versions:\n```\njava -version\nscala -version\n```\n- Make sure your ~/.bash_profile looks like below (might be different depending on your directory):\n```\nexport SPARK_HOME=/Users/dev/spark-2.4.3-bin-hadoop2.7\nexport JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_181.jdk/Contents/Home\nexport SCALA_HOME=/usr/local/scala/\nexport PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$SPARK_HOME/bin:$SCALA_HOME/bin:$PATH\n```\n\n##### For Windows:\nPlease follow the directions found in this helpful StackOverflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25481325/how-to-set-up-spark-on-windows\n",

You’ll need to choose a port number (e.g., 9092, 9093..) for your Kafka topic, and come up with a Kafka topic name and modify the zookeeper.properties and server.properties appropriately.\n\n#### Local Environment\n- Install requirements using `./start.sh` if you use conda for Python. If you use pip rather than conda, then use `pip install -r requirements.txt`.\n\n- Use the commands below to start the Zookeeper and Kafka servers. You can find the bin and config folder in the Kafka binary that you have downloaded and unzipped.\n```\nbin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties\nbin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties\n```\n- You can start the bootstrap server using this Python command: `python producer_server.py`.\n\n#### Workspace Environment\n- Modify the zookeeper.properties and producer.properties given to suit your topic and port number of your choice. Start up these servers in the terminal using the commands:\n```\n/usr/bin/zookeeper-server-start zookeeper.properties\n/usr/bin/kafka-server-start producer.properties\n```\n- You’ll need to open up two terminal tabs to execute each command.\n\n- Install requirements using the provided `./start.sh` script. **This needs to be done every time you re-open the workspace, or anytime after you've refreshed, or woken up, or reset data, or used the \"Get New Content\" button in this workspace.**\n\n- In the terminal, to install other packages that you think are necessary to complete the project, use `conda install <package_name>`. You may need to reinstall these packages every time you re-open the workspace, or anytime after you've refreshed, or woken up, or reset data, or used the \"Get New Content\" button in this workspace.\n\n\n\n",

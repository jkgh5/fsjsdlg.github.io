00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.635
Now that we have a topic,

00:00:01.635 --> 00:00:03.960
let's actually try to produce some data to it.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.789
The first thing we're going to do is connect with a Kafka-console-producer.

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:10.500
So throughout this course,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.449
when we produce and consume data from Kafka,

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.574
we're almost always going to use a Kafka producer or consumer.

00:00:16.574 --> 00:00:19.500
For this example though and sometimes when you're debugging,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.559
it's actually really useful to be able to use this client tool to connect to

00:00:22.559 --> 00:00:27.254
Kafka to either create or read data out of the Kafka broker.

00:00:27.254 --> 00:00:32.159
So again, I'm just going to run Kafka-console-producer command with

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:36.539
no options so that you can see all of the configuration options that it will print out.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:38.100
We're going to go to View,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.070
single document nodes so that it's clear to see what's going on.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.630
So I'm going to hit "Enter",

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.395
and just like the Kafka topics command,

00:00:44.395 --> 00:00:46.400
there are a number of options available here.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.409
Again, you don't need to know all of

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.884
them but I do want to highlight a couple of important ones.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:56.559
The broker lists tells the Kafka-console-producer which Kafka broker to connect to.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.340
You're required to pass this in for

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.040
anything that you want do with the Kafka-console-producer.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.204
That's about it. Other than the fact that you need to specify the topic.

00:01:04.204 --> 00:01:05.659
So when you produce data, you need to

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.829
tell Kafka-console-producer which topic you would like to produce to.

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.094
So let's try that one more time.

00:01:12.094 --> 00:01:14.569
We're going to specify our broker list,

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:16.729
and in this case we're going to use a different URL.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.960
So be careful here. This isn't a zookeeper URL,

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:21.184
this is actually the URL of our Kafka broker.

00:01:21.185 --> 00:01:23.030
So you'll notice the port is different from

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.599
what the Zookeeper port that was on the previous command.

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:28.939
Then we're going to specify the topic that we were using.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.700
So in this case, we were using or we recreated

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.790
my-first-topic and that should be all we need to do.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.520
I go ahead and enter.

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:38.719
Now you can tell it we're connected because of

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.379
this little carrot icon has appeared in the lower left-hand corner.

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:45.019
So we're going to actually start producing some data in here.

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:47.464
I'm going to say, "Hello world."

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:51.730
Then I'm going to say, "Hello world" again,

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.390
and then we can just type in a few more messages just to fill some data into the topic.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.224
Okay, that's enough garbage data in this topic.

00:01:59.224 --> 00:02:01.280
Let's actually disconnect and then

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.579
actually connect to consumer to this topic to see the data come out.

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.844
So I'm going to hit Control, C to exit.

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:12.509
I'm going to clear my workspace that we have a clean slate to work with.

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.239
Now, I'm going to minimize,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.945
go out of Single-Document Mode and we're going to jump down to consuming data.

00:02:20.944 --> 00:02:23.349
You're going to notice what the Kafka-console-consumer.

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.954
Unfortunately, it does not use the broker list syntax to specify the Kafka brokers.

00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:31.115
It uses bootstrap-server.

00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:33.770
I'm not entirely sure why the Kafka team

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.409
decided to be inconsistent with their switches here but

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.780
just note that the switch is not the same between

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.055
the Kafka-console-producer and the Kafka-console-consumer.

00:02:42.055 --> 00:02:44.495
Otherwise, every other setting is the same.

00:02:44.495 --> 00:02:47.245
So we're going to say Kafka-console-consumer

00:02:47.245 --> 00:02:54.849
--topic my-first-topic --bootstrap-server plaintext.

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.805
In fact, the plain text is actually optional.

00:02:56.805 --> 00:02:59.500
We can just type in localhost:9092.

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.340
Go ahead and hit "Enter", see what we missed here.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.979
Go into View, Single-Document Mode.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.399
So we misconfigured something, a typo.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.830
Bootstrap-serer without a V.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.860
So let's try running that command one more time after adding that V in there.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.430
So we've got bootstrap-server with the V now.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.835
Go ahead and hit "Enter". You're going to notice nothing happens.

00:03:28.835 --> 00:03:32.105
It just sits here. What's going on?

00:03:32.104 --> 00:03:36.199
So you might recall from the slides that I mentioned that when you

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:40.060
connect a Kafka-console-consumer or Kafka consumer of any kind,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.224
by default it will only read new messages that are being produced into it.

00:03:46.224 --> 00:03:51.139
Well, we closed our console producer so there are no new messages coming into this topic.

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.334
So there's nothing for this Kafka-console-consumer to do.

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:57.320
So let's actually create some data at the same time.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.944
So I'm going to go out of Single-Document Mode.

00:03:59.944 --> 00:04:02.794
I'm going to increase the size here a little bit,

00:04:02.794 --> 00:04:09.694
and I'm going to go ahead and create another terminal window. All right.

00:04:09.694 --> 00:04:11.299
So I'm going to take this terminal window,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.980
I'm going to split it over here on the right.

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:16.430
This might get a little cramped but I'm going to create a Kafka-console-producer

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.230
just as we did in the previous section and

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.569
we're going to produce more data onto the topic.

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:25.899
Kafka-console-producer, again we're going to connect to the topic, my-first-topic.

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:30.904
We want to use the localhost:9092 broker.

00:04:30.904 --> 00:04:33.544
I'm going to go ahead and Enter and wait for that character show up.

00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:35.675
Okay, so now we can produce data.

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:42.574
So I'm going to just write a new message and hit "Enter", and wait a few seconds.

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:45.464
You can see that our messages have been produced.

00:04:45.464 --> 00:04:49.699
I can produce another message and eventually

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.795
that message will be consumed by the consumer. Now, that's great.

00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:57.170
You've seen how both the producer and the consumer can work together.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.050
I'm going to go ahead and close this producer out because we no

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.329
longer need it and return to just this consumer.

00:05:03.329 --> 00:05:06.430
What if I want to see all of the messages that are in his topic?

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.704
Not just ones that have been freshly produced.

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:12.469
You can add and I'm going to go back to full screen here.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.585
You can add a switch that says dash dash from beginning.

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:22.239
This tells the Kafka consumer that when it starts to consume,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.220
you want it to go to the very beginning of the topic.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.140
So we're just going to hit up.

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.839
So we've got our Kafka-console-consumer command exactly the same as

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:33.979
before and we're just going to add dash dash from the beginning.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.185
Now, we're going to see what happens.

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:38.240
You can see we have a lot more data now.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.650
You can see our first, second,

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:42.769
third and so on messages all get listed.

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:45.740
So if you want to see all the data in a topic,

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.425
just make sure you use this from beginning switch.

00:05:48.425 --> 00:05:51.829
Now, I'd like for you to go ahead and try that in your own exercise,

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:53.849
in your own workspace.

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.074
In the previous section, we mentioned that Kafka is widely used in industry.

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:08.970
Let's quickly review a few of those use cases.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.690
Uber uses Kafka extensively in a real-time pricing models.

00:00:12.689 --> 00:00:16.019
Kafka is the backbone by which a significant portion of the events in

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:19.754
the system are communicated to the various stream processing calculations.

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:22.529
The speed and flexibility of Kafka allow Uber to adjust

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.445
their price to reflect the constantly evolving conditions of the real-world.

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:30.519
Check the notes for more information on how the system works.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.500
Segment is a web analytics company that helps many of

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.494
the world's largest tech companies track and

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:39.765
understand user actions on their applications.

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:42.289
To deal with the sheer volume of data and

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.259
the significant number of data sources and data syncs,

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:48.170
Segment uses Kafka as the routing backbone for

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.965
a significant portion of the data that traverses through their platform.

00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:53.960
Their resilience to failure,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.390
ordering guarantees and scalability make

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.765
Kafka a particularly excellent choice for a tool like Segment.

00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:02.990
Netflix has integrated Kafka as a core component of

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.445
their data platform which they refer to internally as the keystone data pipeline.

00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:10.389
As one of the most popular Internet services in the world,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.200
Netflix has to handle a deluge of data coming from a number of different data sources,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.850
including video viewing activities,

00:01:16.849 --> 00:01:19.564
UI interactions, logs and so on.

00:01:19.564 --> 00:01:22.730
Now, I'm going to mention some numbers here just to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.984
give you a sense of how incredibly skill how Kafka is.

00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:31.400
So the important part takeaway from these numbers is that Kafka can be huge.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:40.670
Netflix sends over 500 billion events and 1.3 petabytes per day into Kafka.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.974
That includes eight million events and 24 gigabytes per second during peak hours.

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.699
Based on those numbers,

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.359
you can probably guess that Kafka is a core part of many of the services you

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:58.200
may use and enjoy on a daily basis at some of the world's biggest tech companies.

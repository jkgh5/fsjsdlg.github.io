00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270
Once a topic has been created with Kafka,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.950
the next step is to send data into the topic.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.644
Applications that send event data into topics are known as Kafka producers.

00:00:09.644 --> 00:00:13.125
From now on, I'm just going to refer to these as producers.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.644
There are many ways to produce data to Kafka,

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:19.079
but applications typically integrate a Kafka client library.

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.239
Excellent client libraries exist for

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.820
almost all programming languages that are popular today,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.225
including Python, Java, Go and others.

00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:30.540
There are many configuration options and considerations for producers,

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.399
just as there were with topics which we're going

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.429
to review in depth also in the next lesson.

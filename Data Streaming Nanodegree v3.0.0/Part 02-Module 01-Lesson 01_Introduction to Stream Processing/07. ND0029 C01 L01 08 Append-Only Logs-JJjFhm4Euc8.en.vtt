00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.180
Append-only logs are a key component of data streams.

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:07.500
In the previous section,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.140
we discussed how data streams are immutable and have

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.875
a guaranteed ordering based on the time the data was produced.

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:16.740
The way that streaming data stores provide this guarantee

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:19.559
is typically by using append-only logs.

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:22.114
Append-only logs are text files in which

00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:26.134
incoming events are written to the end of the log as they are received.

00:00:26.135 --> 00:00:32.420
This simple concept of only ever appending or adding data to the end of a log file are

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.420
what allow stream processing applications to ensure that events are

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.840
ordered correctly even at a high throughput and scale.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.230
We can take this idea a step further and say that in fact streams are append-only logs.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:48.634
Append-only logs are text files in which

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:52.234
incoming events are written to the end of the log as they are received.

00:00:52.234 --> 00:00:54.365
So we have an empty log file here.

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:59.015
As events occur they're going to be written onto log file.

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:04.060
So here we're using logs,and as you can see,

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.454
we would just keep appending logs to the file.

00:01:06.454 --> 00:01:11.239
This simple concept of only ever appending or adding data to the end of

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:13.939
a log file are what allow stream processing applications to

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.614
ensure that events are oral correctly even at high throughput and scale.

00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:19.939
We can take this idea a step further,

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.640
and I just want to emphasize this one more time and say

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.400
that streams are in fact append-only logs.

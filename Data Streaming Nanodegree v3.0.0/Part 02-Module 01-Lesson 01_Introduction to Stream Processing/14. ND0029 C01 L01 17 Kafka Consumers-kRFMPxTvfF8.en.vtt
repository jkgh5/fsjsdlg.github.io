00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.179
Once a topic is being created in Kafka and the data has been placed in the topic,

00:00:04.179 --> 00:00:07.785
we can start to build applications that actually make use of this data stream.

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:13.964
Applications that pull event data from one or more Kafka topics are known as consumers.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:16.545
As with Kafka producers,

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:19.875
I will simply refer to Kafka consumers as consumers

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:23.429
throughout the rest of this lesson and throughout the rest of this course.

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.309
There are many different ways to consume data from Kafka.

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:29.879
But most applications will integrate a Kafka client library.

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.719
All major Kafka client libraries for Python, Java, Go,

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.689
and essentially any other programming language implement

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:40.314
both the producer and consumer interfaces to Kafka itself.

00:00:40.314 --> 00:00:43.339
By default, Kafka consumers will only consume

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.640
data that was produced after first connected to Kafka.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.679
This means that if you connect it to a topic now but 100 records were produced yesterday,

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:55.384
you would not receive these records produced yesterday by default.

00:00:55.384 --> 00:00:57.629
I just want to emphasize that fact.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.370
When you create a consumer and connect to a topic,

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.244
you will not receive historical data by default.

00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:07.564
There are settings you can use to tell Kafka to actually

00:01:07.564 --> 00:01:09.829
get all the historical data that it has available

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.554
and we'll review that in the coming sections.

00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:15.680
Again, similar to both producers and Kafka topics,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.395
there are a number of configuration options to consider.

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:21.239
We're going to cover that in the next lesson.

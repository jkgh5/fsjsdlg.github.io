00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.679
In this section, we'll go hands on with

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:08.039
a Kafka CLI tools to see how Kafka works up close.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.839
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:11.504
you will have created a Kafka topic,

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:12.885
produced data in that topic,

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:14.669
and then consume that same data.

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.324
You'll be well on your way to beginning your Kafka journey.

00:00:17.324 --> 00:00:19.134
I've opened the workspace for you,

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:22.395
where we're going to actually run the Kafka CLI tools,

00:00:22.394 --> 00:00:24.919
as well as some other sample code here in a little bit.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.540
Before we begin, I want to give you a quick overview of the workspace.

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.839
In this class, we're mostly going to be using Python console,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.550
terminal, and text file.

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:36.274
Jupyter notebook is available,

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:38.600
but some of the advanced features that we're going to be using,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.875
won't work well if notebooks.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:42.835
So I recommend that you stick to opening text files.

00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:44.550
To look at mark down files,

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:46.059
you can see that sample 1,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.965
is a Markdown file by the extension MD,

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.440
you right-click, go to open with,

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:53.434
and open Markdown preview.

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:57.995
So you're going to do the same thing in your exercise that follows this demonstration.

00:00:57.994 --> 00:01:03.875
As you can see, we can view the markdown and actually follow the instructions.

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:06.454
Now, to actually run the client,

00:01:06.454 --> 00:01:08.719
we're going to actually need to have a terminal window.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.640
So I'm going to click terminal back on the launcher.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.025
I can also click plus,

00:01:15.025 --> 00:01:17.840
which would open another launcher if I've closed it.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.150
So I'm going to go ahead and open a terminal,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.730
and I'm going to actually click and drag to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.790
resize the terminal because I don't want it to take up the whole window.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.635
I want to be able to reference both the instructions and the terminal at the same time.

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:32.855
I also want a little bit more screen real estate,

00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:37.230
so I'm going to go ahead and click the folder to close that left folder window.

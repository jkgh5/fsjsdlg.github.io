00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.459
In computing, a stream is typically thought of as a potentially unbounded sequence.

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:08.384
So here, we have an event A, B,

00:00:08.384 --> 00:00:12.300
and C. Stream processing is the act of performing

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.255
continual calculations on a potentially endless and constantly evolving source of data.

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:23.835
These endless and constantly evolving sources of data are known as data streams.

00:00:23.835 --> 00:00:28.755
These calculations typically result in output data streams,

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:30.809
and that's what we have here on the right.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.350
When we say endless and constantly evolving source of data,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.015
this doesn't mean that the data is produced at an even or constant rate.

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:41.570
It simply means that the stream does not have a defined start or

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.280
end that the data contained within the stream can change shape and size.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.945
So in this example,

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:50.780
you can see that there's a gap between event C and

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.975
A and we're not producing data at an even rate.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:57.445
You can also see that Y and X are grouped very closely together,

00:00:57.445 --> 00:01:00.409
again, being produced at an uneven rate.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.764
Data also comes in different shapes and sizes.

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:07.280
You can see that C is smaller than A and that Y is smaller than X.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.474
Data streams are made up of immutable data.

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:13.099
Immutable data does not change.

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:16.084
Once the data has been placed in the data stream,

00:01:16.084 --> 00:01:19.944
that specific piece of data can never be updated or changed.

00:01:19.944 --> 00:01:22.009
Now, I've used the lock icons here to

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.410
indicate that once we've created this piece of data,

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.284
it can never be changed again.

00:01:26.284 --> 00:01:30.200
It is possible, say we have a piece of data with

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.734
key B and we want to change the value that the key B points to.

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:37.679
We can create another entry,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.764
another event with the key B and a different value

00:01:41.763 --> 00:01:46.744
to change what the key B represents in our calculation.

00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:50.165
We're going to learn more how this works towards the end of this lesson.

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:54.530
But for now, just keep in mind when you create an event with a specific key,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.215
you can never change that key again.

00:01:57.215 --> 00:02:01.325
The data and data streams are typically individually small.

00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:05.825
In many case, each record or entry is less than one megabyte in size.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:07.159
So on this slide,

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.259
we point to C, B,

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.000
or A or Z, Y,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.120
or X, each one of these data entries or

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.125
data records will be less than one megabyte in size typically.

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:20.495
While the size of the data maybe small,

00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:23.300
stream processing systems may be high throughput.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.965
In some cases streams will receive thousands or tens of thousands of records per second.

00:02:27.965 --> 00:02:30.469
It is also possible and just as common for

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.379
streams to receive infrequent updates or changes.

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.849
So again, we only have three data records on the screen here in the stream,

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.319
but we could have thousands,

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.579
tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands in the span of just a minute.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.070
Likewise, it could take hours to generate just these three events.

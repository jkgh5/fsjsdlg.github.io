00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
So the first thing we're going to do I'll list

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.300
the Kafka topics that we have available on our server.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.969
So run type Kafka-topics,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.530
and I'm going to hit "Enter".

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.209
This isn't going to do anything except print out

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.985
all the various configuration options available to us.

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:18.019
You can see, and real quick I'm actually go to

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.059
"View single document mode" so that we can view more of the screen at once.

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:27.169
There are a number of options available to us with the Kafka topics command.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.870
We're not going to cover most of these in this class,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.054
but I'm going to point out a couple of the important options that you might want to use.

00:00:34.054 --> 00:00:37.210
First there's a create and delete command,

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.390
as always describe, and list.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.109
These commands can be used to create,

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.085
delete or list topics or describe the topic.

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:49.490
Additionally, this --zookeeper option is

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.270
required every time you want to use the Kafka topics command.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.850
Now, if you don't know what Zookeeper is that's okay.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.620
We're going to review some depth at the very beginning of Lesson 2.

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.979
But for now, know that Zookeeper keeps some of the configuration for the Kafka cluster.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.414
So we have to talk to it so that we can get information about the topics.

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:09.430
So now that you've actually seen an overview,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.290
let's list Kafka topics.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.400
So we're going to type in Kafka-topics ---list because we want to list the topics,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.175
and we're going to specify Zookeeper.

00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:21.670
Now, I'm going to minimize this window again so

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.430
that I can show you how you can get the Zookeeper URL.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.840
I've put it in the description here and it's going to be

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.105
the same for you as it is for me in this demonstration.

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:34.505
So we're going to type in localhost:2181 and hit "Enter".

00:01:34.504 --> 00:01:38.000
So you can see, I'm going to resize this window just a little bit,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.459
and this is another nice feature of this new workspace.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.129
You can see that when I resize the window I can see what I've actually run,

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:47.649
and you can see a list of all the Kafka topics that are currently available.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.930
Now, we haven't created a Kafka topic yet,

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.115
so these are all system topics.

00:01:52.114 --> 00:01:56.074
Typically, system topics are prefixed with an underscore,

00:01:56.075 --> 00:01:58.745
and I would not recommend interacting with it if you can avoid it.

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:01.165
Now, we've actually listed a topics,

00:02:01.165 --> 00:02:03.200
let's go ahead and create a topic.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.590
So we're going to use the Kafka topics command again.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.895
We're going to specify the create switch instead of the list switch this time.

00:02:10.895 --> 00:02:14.510
We're also going to tell Kafka the name of the topic that we want to create.

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.854
In this case, we're going to use my-first-topic,

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:20.614
and then we're going to pass these two options here;

00:02:20.615 --> 00:02:22.909
partitions and replication factor.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.655
Don't worry about what this means just now.

00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:28.055
We're going to cover this in more detail in Lesson 2.

00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:30.230
So for now, just pass these values through,

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:32.599
because we have to specify them for Kafka.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.259
Finally, we're going to specify Zookeeper again,

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.649
so that our Kafka cli tool knows how to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.409
talk to the Kafka cluster, and then we're going to hit "Enter".

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.460
Wait just a moment, and you can see

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.805
that we successfully created our topic, "my-first-topic".

00:02:49.805 --> 00:02:53.719
So we can wait up a few times here and then relist

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:57.919
the topics just to confirm that our topic now exists on the Kafka cluster,

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:02.459
and you can see my first topic has been created.

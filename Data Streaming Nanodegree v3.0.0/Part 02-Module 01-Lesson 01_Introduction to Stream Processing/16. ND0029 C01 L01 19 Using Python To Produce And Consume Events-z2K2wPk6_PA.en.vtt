00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.995
Now that we've seen how to use Kafka CLI Tools,

00:00:04.995 --> 00:00:08.445
let's explore how we can use Python to work with Kafka instead.

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:10.785
So if we return to our workspace,

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:13.484
I have now open Sample2.py,

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:15.945
and put it in a window that we can edit.

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:18.225
I've left some TODOs for myself here,

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:20.790
and you're going to see that in your exercises I'll also

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.239
leave you TODOs that you should modify throughout the code.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.515
So you can see we have a couple of functions defined here: produce,

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:33.015
consume as well as the very bottom here,

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.539
a main function where we're going to actually create

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.405
a topic and see if topics already exist.

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:41.575
Let me close this so we can fit it all on the screen.

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:44.895
So we're going to start by actually creating the topics.

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:48.000
Then we're going to go ahead and delete topic if it exists.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.509
I'm going to go back to the top and point out a few more things,

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:52.549
which I'll do for you in yours as well.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:55.519
There's a Broker URL and a topic name.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.320
We're going to use this,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.609
so that you don't have to memorize the Broker URL or the names of the topics.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.234
So here I'm going to copy the topic name,

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:06.334
and return to the main function.

00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:10.099
The first thing we're going to do is create an admin client.

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:15.799
Now, the admin client is used to perform tasks such as creating topics,

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.079
deleting topics, or changing the configuration of a topic on your Kafka cluster.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:28.319
So the first thing we're going to do is specify the bootstrap servers option,

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.704
just as we did on the command line.

00:01:30.704 --> 00:01:40.109
Bootstrap.servers, and we're going to set that equal to the Broker URL.

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.665
That's all we need to get started with the client.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:46.160
So now that we've instantiated the Kafka admin client,

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.484
we can then go ahead and configure our topic.

00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:51.875
So the first thing we need to do is give it a name,

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:55.984
which we're going to set to topic name.

00:01:55.984 --> 00:02:04.219
Then we're going to set, I believe it's actually num partitions equal 1,

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.789
and the replication factor also equal to 1.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.879
Now, one of the things I want to point out,

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.604
and you'll see me do this throughout the class,

00:02:12.604 --> 00:02:13.909
is I typically will always have

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.914
the documentation for the configuration open right on my desktop.

00:02:17.914 --> 00:02:19.944
I've been using Kafka for years at this point,

00:02:19.944 --> 00:02:23.104
and I still reference documentation on a regular basis.

00:02:23.104 --> 00:02:25.729
There are a lot of configuration options for Kafka.

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:29.584
So it's not necessarily a great idea to just try and memorize everything.

00:02:29.585 --> 00:02:32.254
Understanding how things work is what's really important here.

00:02:32.254 --> 00:02:34.370
So I'll show you also how I tend to

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.355
navigate documentation while I walk through exercises.

00:02:37.354 --> 00:02:40.669
I also tend to actually provide links to

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:43.939
the documentation while we're working on these workspaces together.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.254
So as you can see we're working on the admin client,

00:02:47.254 --> 00:02:50.629
and this is the confluent Kafka documentation for the library using.

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.000
So if I wanted to find the admin client,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.275
I can just type it in here in the search bar add enter and then pulled up.

00:02:57.275 --> 00:03:01.235
So this is the documentation for the admin client.

00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:03.040
We're not going to use this right now,

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:05.269
but if I wanted to look up for example,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.950
creating a topic, I can look up the documentation for create topics here.

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:13.939
We can also even go ahead and look at the new topic type.

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.819
So I can type that in here "New

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.419
Topic," and we can see exactly what parameters the new topic would take to be created.

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.719
So you can see back in the workspace here,

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:27.754
I couldn't quite remember,

00:03:27.754 --> 00:03:29.799
was it partitions or num partitions?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.335
Well, if I was wondering,

00:03:31.335 --> 00:03:32.955
I could have just opened the documentation,

00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:36.890
search for new topic and figured out that it's num partitions.

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:38.929
So let's return to our example.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.265
We have topic name,

00:03:40.264 --> 00:03:43.239
num partitions, and replication factor as one.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.265
Now that we have a topic,

00:03:45.264 --> 00:03:49.864
we actually need to tell the Kafka admin client to create the topic on the broker.

00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:53.510
So we're going to use client.create topics.

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.974
We're going to actually provide it the topic that we wanted to create.

00:03:56.974 --> 00:04:01.745
Now here's the thing. This function takes a list of topics.

00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:03.920
So even though we only want to create one topic,

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:06.829
we need to put it inside of a list so that the function

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.990
works properly. That's all there is to it.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.560
We'll now go ahead and create this topic if it doesn't already

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.140
exist. With that, I'm done.

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.004
We also want to set up the delete topics function,

00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:20.074
which again uses the admin client.

00:04:20.074 --> 00:04:22.894
So that when we're done using this topic, we clean it up.

00:04:22.894 --> 00:04:28.430
Again, we're simply going to pass in a list of topics even though we only have one.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.389
So before we move on to do the producer and consumer,

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.784
lets run this topic creation and deletion and see how it works. So I run this.

00:04:36.785 --> 00:04:38.805
I'm just going to run Python,

00:04:38.805 --> 00:04:41.685
Sample2.py in my terminal window.

00:04:41.685 --> 00:04:46.884
Going to hit "Enter," and nothing is really going to happen,

00:04:46.884 --> 00:04:49.284
because we're not actually doing a production or consumption yet.

00:04:49.285 --> 00:04:50.715
So it's going to look like it's hanging,

00:04:50.714 --> 00:04:53.060
but that's actually an indication that it's worked.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.720
If you want to prove this to yourself,

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.175
you could actually look at the Kafka Logs. Let's do that real quick.

00:04:58.175 --> 00:05:03.370
I can click the plus icon here to get a new terminal window.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.685
Then I can actually go ahead and look at the logs.

00:05:07.685 --> 00:05:11.509
So we are going to detail -f var/logs,

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:20.289
and var/log journal, confluence -Kafka.service.log.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.805
I'm just going to highlight this,

00:05:21.805 --> 00:05:25.280
and this will also be in the notes as well if you have trouble remembering this.

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:27.174
So we're going to just tell this file,

00:05:27.175 --> 00:05:29.900
and we can see these are the actions that are actually

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:32.810
happening on Kafka as we're making our changes.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.750
So you can see we have my first Python Kafka Topic 0 has been created.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.970
These logs are a little hard to read,

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.245
but don't be overwhelmed.

00:05:42.245 --> 00:05:44.090
There's a lot of useful information in here.

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:45.829
If you're having trouble getting Kafka work,

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:48.769
this is a good place to come to look for information.

00:05:48.769 --> 00:05:51.229
So we are going to cancel this,

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.520
and we're going to shut down.

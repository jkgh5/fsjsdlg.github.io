00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
In this lesson, we learned what stream processing and

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.269
a streaming data store are and how they work.

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:08.219
We saw how we would use these tools in

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.295
industry and what problems they would solve for us.

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:14.939
We compared and contrasted stream processing with batch processing,

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.225
learned how they were different but also how they're complimentary to each other.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:20.070
We learned what an event is,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.010
why streaming data stores are typically immutable,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.440
and then we saw how Apache Cassandra and Apache Kafka implement log structure storage.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.189
Beyond that, we also saw how Apache Kafka can be used from

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.259
the command line via CLI tools or via the confluent Kafka Python library.

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:41.509
In the next lesson, we're going to learn much more about Kafka and see how

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:46.589
we can configure it for each specific situation that we need to run it in.

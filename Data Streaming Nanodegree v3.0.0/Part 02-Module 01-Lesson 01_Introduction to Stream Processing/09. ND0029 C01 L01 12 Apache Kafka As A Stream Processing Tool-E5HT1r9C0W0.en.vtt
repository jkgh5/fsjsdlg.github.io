00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.924
The Apache Kafka is the streaming data store of choice in this class.

00:00:05.924 --> 00:00:08.219
Beyond this class, Apache Kafka is one of

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.010
those popular streaming data platforms in the industry today.

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.800
Kafka provides a simple message queue interface,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.565
on top of its append only log structured storage Medium.

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:20.294
Kafka is a log of events,

00:00:20.294 --> 00:00:23.955
where traditional message queues are typically used as job queues.

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:27.434
This concept is a core tenet of how to reason about Kafka.

00:00:27.434 --> 00:00:30.254
Kafka and adventure describes something that has happened,

00:00:30.254 --> 00:00:31.544
whereas in a traditional message,

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:35.289
or job queue messages are often requests for an action to be performed.

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.548
Kafka is also highly scalable,

00:00:37.548 --> 00:00:39.994
and offer strict ordering guarantees.

00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:41.654
Kafka is fault tolerant,

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:43.755
meaning that in a well configured cluster,

00:00:43.755 --> 00:00:47.359
one or more nodes can be lost without losing any data.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.820
Kafka was created at LinkedIn to service

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.219
internal stream processing requirements that

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.280
couldn't be met by traditional message queuing systems.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.829
The ideas that they capture in Kafka quickly gained popularity,

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.890
and since then, Kafka has grown to become one of

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.850
the Apache Foundation's most popular projects.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.424
Kafka has been deployed in sizes ranging from

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:09.864
just one node to thousands of nodes successfully.

00:01:09.864 --> 00:01:14.824
It is used extensively in production workloads in companies as diverse as Uber,

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:16.939
Apple, Netflix, and Airbnb,

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.329
in addition to of course LinkedIn.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.129
The creators of Kafka eventually left LinkedIn to

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:24.530
form their own company called Confluent,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.320
to focus full-time on Kafka and its ecosystem.

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.099
Today Confluent continues to introduce excellent and innovative products to

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:34.759
enhance the Kafka ecosystem such as KSQL and Kafka Connect.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.365
We will cover these tools later in this course.

00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:39.434
For now, it is worth mentioning though,

00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:41.549
Apache Kafka is an open source tool,

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.825
as is Kafka Connect,

00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:45.894
and some of the other tools in the ecosystem that we'll discuss.

00:01:45.894 --> 00:01:49.984
Kafka is also a common data store for many popular data streaming tools today,

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:53.670
including Apache Spark, Flink, and Samza.

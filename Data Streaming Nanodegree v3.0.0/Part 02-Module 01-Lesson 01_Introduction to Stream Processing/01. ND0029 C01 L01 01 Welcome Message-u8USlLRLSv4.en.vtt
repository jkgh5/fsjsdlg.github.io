Hi. I'm Ben Goldberg,

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:06.059
and I'll be your instructor for this course.

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:07.229
Before we get started,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.450
I want to tell you a little bit about myself.

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.890
Most of my career has been centered around data engineering of one kind or another.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.740
I spent the beginning of my career working on computer vision,

00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:20.070
teaching airborne systems to understand in parts of the world around them.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.620
I worked on artificial intelligence startup that was able to

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.484
transform raw data sets into written language,

00:00:25.484 --> 00:00:27.289
which is where I had my first introduction to

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.585
many of the concepts we'll cover in this course.

00:00:29.585 --> 00:00:33.310
I'm currently located in Chicago where I'm a staff engineer at SpotHero.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.370
At SpotHero, I founded built and lead our data engineering team.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.154
Beyond my work at SpotHero,

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:42.149
I'm an instructor for the Udacity Data Engineering nanodegree

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.314
having previously taught about airflow.

00:00:44.314 --> 00:00:47.419
I'm also an open source contributor and maintainer for a number of

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.359
data engineering tools such as Kafka Kubernetes charts,

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.549
Airflow, and Schema Registry.

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:54.589
The approaches we're going to cover in this course

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.960
represent the best practices that I've learned throughout

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.109
my day-to-day work as a data engineer

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.280
and through collaborating with colleagues in the space.

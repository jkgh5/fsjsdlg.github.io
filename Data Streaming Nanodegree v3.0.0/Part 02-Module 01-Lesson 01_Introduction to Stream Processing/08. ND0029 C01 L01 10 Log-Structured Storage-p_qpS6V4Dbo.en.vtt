00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.459
As the technology industry has grown,

00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:05.855
so too has the size,

00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:07.655
scale, and speed of our data.

00:00:07.655 --> 00:00:10.199
In parallel, business users are increasingly

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.634
demanding quicker and quicker access to insights from this data.

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:16.094
The competing pressures of these issues

00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:19.094
has led to a renaissance in data storage solutions.

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:22.410
One of the key innovations over the past decade in computing has been

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.774
the emergence of log-structured storage as a primary means of storing data.

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:29.500
Distinct log-structured storage solutions were

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.118
built to leverage the benefits of stream processing,

00:00:32.118 --> 00:00:35.509
event-driven architectures, and append-only logs.

00:00:35.509 --> 00:00:39.259
Common characteristics of all log-structured storage systems

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:42.559
are that they simply append data to log files on disk.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.925
These log files may store data indefinitely for a specific time period,

00:00:46.924 --> 00:00:49.729
or until a specific size is reached.

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.089
There are typically many log files on disk,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.109
and these log files are merged and compacted occasionally.

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.240
When a log file is merged,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.275
it means that two or more log files are joined together into one output log file.

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:07.830
When a log file is compacted,

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.390
it means that the data from one or more files is deleted.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.109
Deletion is typically determined by the age of the record.

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.575
The oldest records are removed while the newest stay.

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:23.750
We'll cover log compaction and management in depth in the next lesson.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.694
Why do these systems use many log files instead of one?

00:01:27.694 --> 00:01:29.959
If there were only one log file,

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.719
the speed of the streaming data stores will be limited to

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:37.170
the I/O speed of reading a single file off of disk.

Faust provides model types that can be plugged into standard Python objects to

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:11.324
make serialization and deserialization of topic data a simple exercise.

00:00:11.324 --> 00:00:13.079
As you learned in lesson 3,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.219
managing data schemas is an important part of the process of working with streaming data.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:19.634
Thankfully, Faust makes it easy.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:20.940
In the following sections,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.920
you'll learn how to use Faust to pack and unpack data with very few lines of code.

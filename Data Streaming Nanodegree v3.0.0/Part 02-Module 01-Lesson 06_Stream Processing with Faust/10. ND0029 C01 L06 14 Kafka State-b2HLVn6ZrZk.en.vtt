00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.069
Like most stream processing frameworks,

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:07.109
files keeps track of all of its state in a Kafka Topic dedicated for each stream.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.760
Doing so, keeping this changelog allows Faust to scale up from

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.675
one node to thousands of processing nodes without skipping a beat. How does this work?

00:00:16.675 --> 00:00:19.830
Well, similar to the way any Kafka producer works.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.979
As events happen in our stateful table,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.125
say a user makes an additional purchase,

00:00:24.125 --> 00:00:26.719
and we update the total value of their lifetime purchases,

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:29.904
an event is emitted for that specific event.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:33.030
Essentially, anytime a change occurs,

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.429
Faust emits an event to the changelog topic with the change details.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:39.515
Using this compact changelog topic,

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:41.840
files can recreate state on boot by

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.570
reading through the topic before beginning to process messages.

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.699
Throughout this lesson, you've learned a great deal about Faust and

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.134
how you can use it to build your own stream processing applications.

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:12.750
You've seen how to create a basic Faust application from scratch.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.304
You've also seen how to serialize and de-serialize data,

00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:17.625
and in the process,

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.519
how Faust can give us a hand in type verification.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.954
We learned how Faust uses Kafka to store the change log

00:00:23.954 --> 00:00:27.584
and uses either an in-memory or RocksDB based store,

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:29.745
to store its own local state.

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:33.210
Finally, we learned about building stream applications and

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.664
table applications and the nuances of both of those approaches.

00:00:37.664 --> 00:00:42.280
Faust is an awesome tool for building world-class stream processing applications.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.929
I hope that you enjoyed this lesson and find these skills

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.664
useful next time you'd like to try to build one of these applications on your own.

00:00:48.664 --> 00:00:52.159
I think you'll especially enjoy contrasting Faust with

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.534
KSQL which we're about to learn about in the upcoming lesson.

00:00:55.534 --> 00:00:58.309
Both of them are incredible tools that will help

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.370
you build some really amazing stream processing applications.

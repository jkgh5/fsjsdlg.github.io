00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
The second option for storing application state locally is to use RocksDB.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.410
RocksDB as we learned in the previous lesson,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.839
is a highly performing datastore that runs

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.004
side-by-side with your stream processing application.

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:15.645
As changes are made in your streaming tables,

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:17.850
the state is stored in RocksDB,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.445
in addition to being sent to Kafka.

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:26.149
The RocksDB instance simply stores the state of the world at that point in time on disk.

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.390
If your application were to crash or restart for any reason,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.850
as soon as it recovers it will connect RocksDB

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.804
and instantly begin processing records once again.

00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:36.679
Because of these characteristics,

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:40.104
it's always recommended to use RocksDB in production.

00:00:40.104 --> 00:00:44.284
RocksDB is simple to use and requires no configuration on your part.

00:00:44.284 --> 00:00:48.659
You simply need to have the library installed in your machine to make use of it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.439
In the previous lesson,

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.719
we learned about three windowing approaches.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.330
Tumbling, hopping and sliding windows.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.449
Remember that sliding and hopping are related windowing approaches,

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.649
but that sliding is typically implemented as a very minimal hopping increment.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.245
Faust provides tumbling and hopping windows,

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.480
but doesn't provide a sliding window type.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.144
Now, you can approximate it with your own hopping window definition if you'd like.

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:25.574
Windows only applied at tables.

00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:29.774
Windows define what period of data we should keep for aggregated data.

00:00:29.774 --> 00:00:32.579
Tumbling windows take only one argument,

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.004
the size of the window.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.000
The argument is specified as a Python timedelta.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.850
So the onscreen example is a five-minute tumbling window.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.579
Hopping windows take two arguments: the size of the window and the step.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.384
In the example on screen,

00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:49.820
we've again defined a size of five minutes.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.320
However, we've also defined that we'd like our hopping windows step to be one-minute.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.965
Both tumbling and hopping windows accept an optional expires key,

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:03.170
which tells Faust how long to maintain the data for each window.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.730
So here we've said,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.040
keep the data for 60 minutes,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.285
which means that all the window data,

00:01:09.284 --> 00:01:13.459
even if it's a previous window that's no longer current,

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:16.619
will be kept for at least an hour.

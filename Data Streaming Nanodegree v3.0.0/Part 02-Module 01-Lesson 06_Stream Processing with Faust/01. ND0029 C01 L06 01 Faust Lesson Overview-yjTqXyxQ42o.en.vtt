00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.259
In the previous lesson,

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.580
we developed a strong conceptual understanding of the fundamentals of stream processing.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.984
Now, it's time that we apply that knowledge in Python.

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:16.019
In this lesson, we're going to learn how to use the Python stream processing library

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.339
Faust to rapidly create powerful stream processing applications.

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:04.679
Now, let's return back to

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:08.134
the previous example one more time and instead of using a tumbling window,

00:00:08.134 --> 00:00:10.099
let's use a hopping window.

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.359
The first thing we're going to do is define the size of the window.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.899
Here we're going to have a three second size.

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:23.049
We're going to have a step of five seconds,

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.324
and we'll use an expires time of 10 minutes.

00:00:29.324 --> 00:00:33.100
So the expires time isn't something that we really need to see in this demo.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.065
I just want to show you how to pass this variable.

00:00:35.064 --> 00:00:38.169
Remember, expires tells first

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.760
that it can keep around the data from previous windows for up to 10 minutes.

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:47.945
Size says I want a window size of 30 seconds.

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:50.344
But the step says every five seconds,

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:53.314
I want you to move that window forward.

00:00:53.314 --> 00:00:59.239
So let's go ahead and run this example. All right.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.550
So we can see our example advancing forward,

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:05.469
and it's little hard to see because of how fast it's running.

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:12.405
But you can see here USD is 18547078 and if we keep scrolling,

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.460
let's see where we got twos.

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:22.530
Now you can see that the US dollar is now reset to 91494.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.890
So it's a little hard to see,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.430
but you can see we went from this number.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.640
So we went from 18547078 to 91494.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.349
So you can see that the window is rolling

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:36.959
over and incrementing at these five second chance.

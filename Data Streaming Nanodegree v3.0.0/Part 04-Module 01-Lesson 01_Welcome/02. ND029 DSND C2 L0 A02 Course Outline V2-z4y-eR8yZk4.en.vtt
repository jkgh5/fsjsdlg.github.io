00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.565
Let's take a look at the course outline.

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:04.110
In your first lesson,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.555
you will begin with streaming DataFrames in Spark,

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:08.565
including starting a Spark cluster,

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:10.530
deploying a Spark application,

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.885
creating a streaming DataFrame with Kafka and creating and querying a Spark View.

00:00:15.885 --> 00:00:19.550
In the second lesson, you'll work with joint and JSON,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.739
including parsing a JSON payload into separate fields for analysis,

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.834
joining two streaming DataFrames,

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:28.715
and writing a streaming DataFrame to Kafka.

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:30.635
In the third and last lesson,

00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:32.015
you'll work with Redis,

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:36.785
Base64, and JSON, including manually saving to Redis,

00:00:36.785 --> 00:00:39.275
reading Redis data from a Kafka topic,

00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:45.560
parsing Base64 encoded information and sinking a subset of JSON fields.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.680
In the project you complete at the end of the course,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.615
you will evaluate human balance,

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:56.400
applying techniques from the course to a real-world streaming analytics application.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
Let's talk about Data streaming.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.570
One of the best examples of a data stream is the stream of consciousness.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.700
Thoughts are constant when awake.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.280
They are constantly changing and evolving.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.990
They start with one subject,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.600
and can move to another topic very quickly.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.390
Multiple inputs are aggregated to form ideas and conclusions.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.880
Just as in our consciousness,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.090
the world around us generates loads of information.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.810
A real-world event is often responsible for producing

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.665
the stream of information ingested by a streaming application.

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:39.750
An application event is created in response to a real-world event.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.375
A listener responsible for responding to this event ingests it.

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:48.240
As a result, a new insight is produced.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.915
Let's talk about the tools and environment that you will use in the course.

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:07.500
You should already be familiar with SQL,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.895
Python, and it may be helpful to understand ETL.

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:16.875
Some of the tools you will learn to use in this course include: Bash,

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:23.550
Kafka, Redis, Spark, and Draw.io.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.920
Some examples of tools that are used elsewhere in streaming include JMS,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.990
RabbitMQ, Hadoop, SQS, and Firebase.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:39.050
I'd like to introduce you to the workspace that we'll be using in this course.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.085
The workspace has several tools installed already for you,

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:45.980
including Spark and Kafka,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.735
as well as Redis.

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:51.035
In the workspace we start Spark manually.

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:54.380
This is not required in a typical Spark environment.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.765
In addition, we use the Start Kafka button to startup Kafka.

00:00:59.765 --> 00:01:02.120
In a production or test environment,

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.850
both Spark and Kafka will typically be set up already and will be constantly running.

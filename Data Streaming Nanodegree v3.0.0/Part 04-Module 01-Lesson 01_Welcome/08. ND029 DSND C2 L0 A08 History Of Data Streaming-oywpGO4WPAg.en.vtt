00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.135
Let's talk about the history of data streaming.

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:05.805
As we described in the waterfall scenario,

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:08.190
the water we use for our survival comes from

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.205
reservoirs and streams that deliver the water to us.

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:15.090
The foundation for all streaming technology lies in the ability

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.275
to transmit electronic messages from one system to another.

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:24.840
In 1964, the IBM system 360 was created,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.200
including the BTAM and QTAM frameworks,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.425
which are basic and Queued telecommunications access methods.

00:00:32.425 --> 00:00:35.969
In 1971, IBM offered TCAM,

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.895
telecommunications access method, which included more advanced message routing.

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:47.485
In 1992, IBM announced the MQ series available off the mainframe.

00:00:47.485 --> 00:00:54.050
In 1998, Sun Micro-systems published the Java Message Service specification.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.200
In 1999, Andy Stanford-Clark and Arlen Nipper authored MQTT.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.220
While the early development of messaging was concentrated around large corporations,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.260
smaller companies began to develop

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.350
groundbreaking technology that would evolve to what we currently know as data streaming.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.790
In 2003, Apache Nutch was created by Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.450
Apache Nutch moved to Apache Hadoop project in 2006.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.525
In 2007, Rabbit Technologies,

00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:32.425
LTD developed Rabbit MQ.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:39.275
In 2009, Spark was started by Matei Zaharia at UC Berkeley.

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:43.795
In 2011, Kafka was developed by LinkedIn.

00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:49.070
In 2013, Spark was donated to the Apache Foundation.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.220
In 2017, Spark 2.2 was released with Kafka streaming support.

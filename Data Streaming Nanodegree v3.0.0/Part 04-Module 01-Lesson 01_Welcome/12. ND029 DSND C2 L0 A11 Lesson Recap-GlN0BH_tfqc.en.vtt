00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.465
Let's go over what we've talked about so far.

00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:07.080
We've had an introduction to Apache Spark,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.030
talked about why data streaming is important, and discussed stakeholders.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.940
We then discussed when to use data streaming,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.920
the history of data streaming,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.795
your tools and environment,

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:21.880
and then discuss the final project.

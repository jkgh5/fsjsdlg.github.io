00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
I'd like to introduce you to the project you'll be working on to wrap up this course.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.560
You work for the Data Science team at STEDI,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.530
a small start-up focused on assessing balance for seniors.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.765
STEDI has an application that collects data from seniors during a small exercise.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:20.925
Your product manager has requested a graph that shows fall risk for recent assessments.

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:25.080
Your job is to collect data from Redis and the application,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.690
join the data and provide a new Kafka topic to properly display data in the graph.

Data streaming should not be considered a universal solution to all data requirements.

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:10.440
There are certain elements that do make a project more ideal for a data stream project.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.155
There must be a way of producing the information that is needed.

00:00:14.155 --> 00:00:16.760
For example, I want to know how many times

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.330
a user clicks on my website per hour in real time,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.645
the data should be actionable in a real-time manner.

00:00:23.645 --> 00:00:26.480
For example, I want to pop a chat bot to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.835
users who click more than 100 times per hour on my website.

00:00:30.835 --> 00:00:34.490
The proposed solution must provide business value.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.175
Value is often defined as something that is worth more traded for the resources expended.

00:00:40.175 --> 00:00:44.090
Your stake holders should agree the proposed project has merit.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.219
Just because something is interesting,

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.680
doesn't mean it provides value to your business.

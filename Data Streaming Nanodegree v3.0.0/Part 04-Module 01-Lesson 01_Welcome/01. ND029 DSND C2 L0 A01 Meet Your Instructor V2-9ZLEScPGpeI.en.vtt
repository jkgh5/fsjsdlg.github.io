00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Hello, my name is Sean Murdock,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.285
and I'm a data geek.

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:06.450
Welcome to the data streaming with Apache Spark course.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.860
I will be your teacher.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.100
I've worked with data streaming since the beginning of my career,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.680
from connected cars to automated invoices,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.320
there has always been a data stream to interest me.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.070
I've seen several technologies become available over that time.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.500
I would say that Spark and Kafka represent

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.990
the two best technologies to use with streaming.

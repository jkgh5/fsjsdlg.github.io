00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Let's talk about why data streaming is important.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.550
The world around us has become filled with

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.775
opportunities to gain valuable streams of data.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:12.105
Let's take a video streaming platform, for example,

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:14.505
in a simple process of watching a video,

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:19.200
the average person generates and consumes various types of data.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.500
The actual video feed is itself a data stream,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.655
sending thousands of frames per minute in small network packets.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:28.665
Like the network packets,

00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:32.669
most streams are composed of small application messages,

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.060
as user logging into view their favorite TV series will

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.060
present their online profile as they log in to the website.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.680
Then several events take place that make

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.605
their video available for viewing in the browser,

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:49.280
hopping on their cell phone to take the rest of the video on the road,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.970
the mobile app will send device messages to catch up to the previously played frame.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.750
All of the messages both created and consumed in this process of viewing

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.325
videos can be aggregated and used to recommend future video selections to the user.

00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:10.520
A brief analogy to data streaming is a real stream or river,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.920
what we are trying to do with data streaming is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.470
capture the streaming data directly from the stream.

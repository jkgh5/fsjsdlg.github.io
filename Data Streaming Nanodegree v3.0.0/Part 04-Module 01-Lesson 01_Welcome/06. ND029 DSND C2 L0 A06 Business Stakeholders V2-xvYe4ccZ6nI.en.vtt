00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
On a data stream project,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.765
there can be multiple stakeholders.

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:06.750
It may be helpful to think of each of them in terms of

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.915
consumers and producers of information.

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:14.010
The application development team produces data streams you will consume.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.115
They also consume data streams you will produce.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:19.350
Data engineering teams may maintain

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.010
the infrastructure you use to run streaming applications.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.430
Often, data science is the area responsible for

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.895
creating and maintaining streaming applications.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:35.145
C-level executives come to rely on rapidly available recommendations,

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:37.485
produced by streaming analytics.

00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:39.975
Running a company can be very challenging,

00:00:39.975 --> 00:00:43.090
unless the right information is available.

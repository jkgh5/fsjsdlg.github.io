00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.590
So in this lesson,

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.264
we learned the fundamentals of Spark's core building blocks, RDDs,

00:00:05.264 --> 00:00:11.189
DataFrames, and datasets, and how to use Spark web UI to monitor and debug Spark jobs.

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:15.779
You can now build a simple Spark application that focuses on batch processing.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:17.460
Now, in the next lesson,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.920
you're ready to dive into building Spark

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.980
streaming applications using structural streaming APIs.

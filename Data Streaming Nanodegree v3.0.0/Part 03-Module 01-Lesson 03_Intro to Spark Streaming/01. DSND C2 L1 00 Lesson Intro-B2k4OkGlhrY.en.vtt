00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
Welcome to the Spark and data and streaming course.

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.915
You'll be first learning Apache Spark fundamentals,

00:00:05.915 --> 00:00:10.199
which will help you build a Spark batch application and then we'll be learning

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.779
general concepts of about streaming in the data world and

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.855
specifically learning to use Spark structured streaming.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:19.410
We will prepare you to start using structured streaming APIs and

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.800
then dive into integrating Spark structured streaming with Kafka,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.975
which you learned about it in previous course.

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:26.370
By the end of the course,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.650
you will complete a project that will prepare you to

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.959
start building streaming applications at your job.

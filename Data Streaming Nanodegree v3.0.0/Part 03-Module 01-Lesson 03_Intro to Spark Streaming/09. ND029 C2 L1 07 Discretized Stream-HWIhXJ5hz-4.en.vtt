00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
So now that we've covered the building blocks of Apache Spark's core component,

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.734
I'd like to start talking about the streaming component.

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:11.820
Spark DStream discretized stream is the basic abstraction of Spark Streaming.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.070
There are two ways of generating DStream;

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.295
receive input from various sources like Kafka, Flume,

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:19.695
Kinesis or TCP sockets,

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:23.190
or generate a new DStream from an existing DStream.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.060
Any operation on a DStream applies to the underlying RDDs.

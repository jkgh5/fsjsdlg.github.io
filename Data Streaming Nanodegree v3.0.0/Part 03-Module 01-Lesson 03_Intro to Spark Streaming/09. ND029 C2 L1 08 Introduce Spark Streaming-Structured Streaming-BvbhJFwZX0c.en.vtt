00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
Let's talk about how D Stream ingest the data.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.950
Most likely, your data in

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.150
real-world application will have a bunch of data coming in a few seconds.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.109
So instead of processing the streaming data one record at a time,

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:17.129
Spark Streaming discretizes the streaming data into micro batches.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:19.739
Each batch of data is an RDD.

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.469
This allows the developers like us to apply

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:26.414
basic RDD operations on top of D Streams as well.

00:00:26.414 --> 00:00:31.769
In D Stream, each message is guaranteed to be processed once and only once.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.789
There are many applicable domains where we need to

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.269
process large data streams like ETL operations,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.425
operations monitoring, ad monetization,

00:00:41.424 --> 00:00:44.919
retail, fraud detection, and etc.

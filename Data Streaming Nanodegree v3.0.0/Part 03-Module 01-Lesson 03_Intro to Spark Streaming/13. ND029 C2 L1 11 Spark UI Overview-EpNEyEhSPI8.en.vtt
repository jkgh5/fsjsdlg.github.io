00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
In this concept, we'll learn what a DAG is in Apache Spark.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.855
DAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graphs.

00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:09.359
We'll take a look at what the DAG scheduler is,

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.189
how to create DAGs in Spark,

00:00:11.189 --> 00:00:13.664
and how they help in achieving fault-tolerance.

00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:18.929
We'll also learn how DAGs work in RDD and the advantages of DAGs in Spark,

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.649
which creates the differences between Apache Spark and Hadoop MapReduce.

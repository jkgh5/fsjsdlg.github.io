00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
In this lesson, we'll go over the components of Apache Spark

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.929
and focus on the ones that we'll be using throughout the course.

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:09.059
Many compare Hadoop and Spark,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.214
but Spark is more comparable to the MapReduce algorithm of Hadoop ecosystem.

00:00:13.214 --> 00:00:15.960
Apache Spark is a powerful alternative to

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.804
Hadoop MapReduce with several rich functionalities like machine learning,

00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:23.129
real time stream processing, and graph computations.

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.519
Apache Spark is gaining popularity and is emerging as

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.785
the standard execution engine in Hadoop because of it's extensible and flexible APIs,

00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:33.570
high-performance, ease of use,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.865
and increased developer productivity.

00:00:35.865 --> 00:00:39.240
Mainly, we'd like to focus on Spark Core, SQL,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.789
and streaming components, and explore commonly used APIs,

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.659
and how those really work behind.

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:47.689
We'll also look at the core building blocks for Spark,

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:49.594
which are RDDs, DataFrame,

00:00:49.594 --> 00:00:53.759
and data set, and how the functions for these collections work.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.924
DAG, stands for Directed Acyclic Graph.

00:00:02.924 --> 00:00:06.960
This means that the graph has a direction and is not circular.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.960
Like many graphs, DAG also has vertices and edges.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.400
The vertices of DAG are RDDs and the edges are

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.660
operations like transformation functions applied on the RDDs.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.600
Stages are a terminology used in Spark to annotate grouped tasks.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.080
These will all be available as visuals on Spark UI,

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.884
and you can set the port number on your application

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:33.965
using the config parameter on Spark.ui.ports.

00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:36.245
How do DAGs work in Spark?

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:40.864
DAG is an optimized execution plan with minimized data shuffling.

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:44.225
When any action is called on an RDD,

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:48.145
Spark creates a DAG and submits it to the DAG Scheduler.

00:00:48.145 --> 00:00:52.295
The DAG Scheduler devise operators into stages of tasks.

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:55.940
That DAG Scheduler knows how to pipeline operators together,

00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:00.804
and many map operators may be scheduled into a single stage depending on your code.

00:01:00.804 --> 00:01:04.605
The stages are passed onto the Task Scheduler.

00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:09.109
The Task Scheduler launches tasks through a cluster manager.

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.584
This is your yarn or amazes.

00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:14.509
Although tasks scheduler launches the task,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.475
it doesn't always know about the dependencies of the stages.

00:01:18.474 --> 00:01:23.669
Finally, the primary node assigns the tasks to secondary nodes.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.680
The lineage graph explains a history of RDD transformations.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.495
It's a graph of all the parent RDDs of the current RDD.

00:01:31.495 --> 00:01:36.910
DAG will show all the different stages, transformations and actions.

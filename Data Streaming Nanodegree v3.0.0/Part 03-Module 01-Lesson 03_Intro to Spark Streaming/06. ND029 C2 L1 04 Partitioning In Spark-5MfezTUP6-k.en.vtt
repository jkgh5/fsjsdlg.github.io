00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
There are two types of partitioning in Spark; Hash and Range.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.085
Hash partitioning consists of the traditional way of hash partitioning,

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:12.525
like partition equals hash code modulus number of partitions.

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:15.240
Range partitioning is where tuples

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.615
containing the same key will appear in the same machine.

00:00:18.614 --> 00:00:23.044
The order and the range of the keys determine where the data will be stored.

00:00:23.045 --> 00:00:27.145
This means there could be skewed data and skewed data is unavoidable.

00:00:27.144 --> 00:00:29.419
Also, this might not be a spark problem,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.905
but rather a data problem.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:32.179
So as a data engineer,

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:36.140
it's our job to make sure that the data can be processed with minimal skill.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.855
For example, let's say you're a data engineer in retail organization,

00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:42.814
and your data is partitioned by date,

00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:44.509
like year, month, day.

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:47.524
Let's say during the holidays like Black Friday,

00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:49.460
bunch of people buy a bunch of stuff,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.835
then your data will be heavily skewed if you choose to use or date as partition key.

00:00:54.835 --> 00:00:59.280
This means you'll have to come up with another way of partitioning your data.

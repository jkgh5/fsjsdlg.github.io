00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.804
Hi. My name is Jillian and I have worked at Samsung,

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:09.309
in Korea and also an ad tech startup in San Francisco.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:18.679
Mostly my career has been building actually big data platforms and ingestion pipelines.

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.119
The concept that I'll be teaching in this course,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.644
I will be applying or I have applied at my previous jobs

00:00:31.644 --> 00:00:36.719
that when a streaming analytics was required,

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:44.239
I've used Spark streaming and Kafka which will be actually the students final project.

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.725
Everything has been about data recently,

00:00:54.725 --> 00:01:01.155
and it is crucial to a lot of businesses that are streaming,

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:05.465
not just streaming but small micro batches or

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:10.775
even a single event of streams have been happening more recently like retails,

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:15.710
banks like finances, anything that you can think of.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:19.024
So I think it is very important that you stay on top of

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:25.380
the new technology and start learning on streaming analytics.

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:37.564
Throughout this course, the students will learn a generic idea of streaming.

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.590
We'll be using Spark Streaming but you can also apply

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.909
these ideas to Apache Flink, ApacheSpark,

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.929
any other streaming libraries and also we'll be using one of

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.845
the most popular data ingestion for streaming.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:54.679
This course we'll be using Kafka but you can apply the same

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.600
constant to either use Kubernetes or GCP if you really want to use that,

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:04.369
and we'll be integrating these two concepts to generate and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.960
repeat like a POC product that you can use for your showcase or portfolio.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.805
The students can definitely apply for any data engineering jobs,

00:02:21.805 --> 00:02:25.760
although we are not going heavily over data warehousing projects.

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:30.544
But the students who will be able to make

00:02:30.544 --> 00:02:35.674
a small pipeline that is a simple ETL pipeline for example.

00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:43.600
So I think they can definitely apply for a starting out data engineering jobs.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.980
I will say the hiring managers would look for some data warehousing skills,

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:58.789
data analytic skills, and data pipeline skills.

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:02.060
So this is more like a software engineer who

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.545
is building out an application that does data streaming and analytics.

00:03:06.544 --> 00:03:10.369
I'll be covering building out an ETL pipeline mostly so

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.890
that we integrate a data source and data streaming pipelines,

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:17.759
and some statistical analysis at the end.

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:21.334
We'll be able to definitely cover some essential part

00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:26.159
of the skill set that's required by some hiring managers.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.020
I've used it for some real-time analytics,

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.270
it's helpful when you have a bunch of data coming in so you don't

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.675
always want to do

00:03:45.675 --> 00:03:50.465
a batch like an hour or two or even like a half a day of batch processing,

00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:55.920
this is useful when you're using few minutes or even few seconds on Windows.

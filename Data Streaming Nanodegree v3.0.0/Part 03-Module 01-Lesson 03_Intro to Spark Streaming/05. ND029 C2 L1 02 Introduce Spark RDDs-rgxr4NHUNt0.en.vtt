00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.889
Let's start talking about RDDs.

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:07.710
The RDD, Resilient Distributed Dataset is the fundamental data structure of Apache Spark.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.650
An RDD is an immutable collection of objects.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.620
This means an RDD is a read only dataset,

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.539
and the only way to create an RDD is to load a dataset or paralyze a dataset

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.105
or to convert an existing RDD into a new one using transformation operations.

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:27.644
RDDs compute on a different nodes of the cluster.

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:31.410
Each and every dataset in a spark RDD is logically partitioned

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.585
across many servers so that they can be computed on different nodes of the cluster.

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:40.270
RDD stands for Resilient.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.575
RDDs are fault tolerant, in other words,

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:46.250
they possess self recovery capabilities in case of failure.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.895
Distributed. Since data resides on multiple nodes,

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:53.375
a dataset represents records of the data you work with.

00:00:53.375 --> 00:00:57.890
The user can load a dataset externally which can be either adjacent file,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.390
CSV file, text file or database with no specific data structure.

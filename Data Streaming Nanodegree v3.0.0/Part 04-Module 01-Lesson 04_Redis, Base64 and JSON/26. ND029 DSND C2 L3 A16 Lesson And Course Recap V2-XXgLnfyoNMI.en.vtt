00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
Let's go over what you've done in this lesson and what comes next.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.000
After finishing this lesson,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.460
you should be able to manually save and read from

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.475
Redis parse Base64 encoded information and sink a subset of JSON.

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:16.875
Let's look at the course overview.

00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:20.820
You just learned about Redis, Base64, and JSON.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.305
Next, you will get to work with a real-world challenge to evaluate human balance.

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:29.400
You'll apply techniques from the course to a streaming analytics application.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.890
I hope you are ready to put your skills to the test.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Redis and Base64 are not always used together.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.080
In this lesson, we will be using Redis and Base64 together.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.410
Let's start talking about why we would use Redis.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.550
Redis is a database used primarily for caching,

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.640
this means it is optimized for fast reads and writes.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.670
Redis is used by a lot of companies.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.520
This makes it worthwhile to learn how to use Redis.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.930
Also, Redis is great for rapid prototyping of new applications.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.500
This can take you well beyond a proof of concept all the way to

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.215
production without having to create or maintain schemas.

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:37.759
Later, you can create a structured schema,

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:40.235
and migrate to a relational database,

00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:44.495
or stay with Redis and create a nightly extract for reports.

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:51.235
In either case, Redis is super-fast both in terms of execution and in development.

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:54.810
Base64 is the encoding of the Internet.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.700
It is used to make certain texts more easily readable by servers.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.750
In this example, the URL has a long encoded string.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.005
Decoding the string is the latitude and longitude where the takeout is needed.

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:15.090
Base64 is an encoding format used by computers to transmit and store information.

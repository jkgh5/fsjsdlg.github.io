00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
The first thing I'm going to do is make sure that Kafka and Spark are running.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.235
I'm going to type ps -ef.

00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:09.915
I see Spark running once and twice.

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:14.430
I also see several Java processes which tells me that Kafka is working.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.735
The next thing I'm going to do is actually connect to Redis.

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:23.760
I can see that Redis is running right here, so that's a good sign.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.460
I'm going to say /data/redis/redis-stable/src/redis-cli

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.660
and -a which is for my password,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.800
which is not a very good password.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.930
Now, I'm going to do keys.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.830
That tells me all the tables that I have right now.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:52.380
I'm going to just do a simple set operation, testkey testvalue.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.210
Now, the cool thing is,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.310
I'm not going to hit "Enter" yet.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.560
I want to show you something.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.660
Because we have a Kafka source for Redis setup,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.920
what that means is that all the data we write to Redis shows up in a topic.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.415
Let's go connect to that topic.

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:13.700
I'm going to cd to data/kafka/bin.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.680
If I ls, I can do kafka-console-consumer, with dot slash.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.960
I want to say, bootstrap-server localhost:9092,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.415
the topic is redis-server.

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:37.150
That's the topic that we configured in the Kafka source connector.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.980
It's putting all the Redis data into that topic,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.800
because we configured it to and I want it from the beginning.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.650
I'll see a bunch of data from Redis,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.110
and there it goes by.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.650
Most of these keys are pretty large,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.365
so this represents an application in use.

00:01:54.365 --> 00:01:56.735
All of the stuff coming through here,

00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:59.380
it's like a live application being used.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.990
This is what it would look like.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.025
When I do set testkey,

00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:09.675
that's putting the key as testkey and my value as testvalue in Redis.

00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:11.930
As you see things scrolling by here,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.964
you're going to see keys that are Base64 encoded.

00:02:15.964 --> 00:02:21.275
Let's see what testkey looks like in Base64 format.

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:24.040
I'm going to create a new terminal.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.720
Let's say, echo testkey,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.045
pipe it to Base64,

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:33.210
and that's what it looks like.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.410
Testkey in Base64 looks like this.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.550
When I set this and come over to the topic,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.485
I should see that key.

00:02:42.485 --> 00:02:46.190
I'm going to do it pretty quick and then I'm going to break out of

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.880
this console consumer so we can check it.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.710
I'm going to hit "Enter" here,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.455
and then I'm going to break over here.

00:02:54.455 --> 00:02:59.460
Let's see. The keys will be dGVzdGtleQ0.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:12.500
Testkey dGVzdGtleQ.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.305
What's interesting is,

00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:19.680
that doesn't have the last 0 in it.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.600
But if I echo it and pipe it to base64 -d,

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.180
sure enough, it comes back as testkey.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.290
That shows us that

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.775
the Redis Kafka source connector is working and when I put data into Redis,

00:03:37.775 --> 00:03:40.710
it comes out in my topic.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.735
This is the third lesson of the Apache Spark streaming course.

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:08.215
This lesson covers Redis, Base64, and JSON.

00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:10.250
Let's look at the course overview.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.585
You just learned about Joins and JSON.

00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:16.470
In this lesson, we'll become familiar with manually saving to Redis,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.840
reading the same data from a Kafka topic,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.780
parsing Base64 encoded information,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.335
and sinking a subset of JSON fields.

00:00:25.335 --> 00:00:28.065
Upon completion of lesson 3,

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:33.765
you should be able to successfully complete the following: manually save to Redis,

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:36.615
read the same data from a Kafka topic,

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:39.585
parse Base64 encoded information,

00:00:39.585 --> 00:00:42.760
sink a subset of JSON fields.

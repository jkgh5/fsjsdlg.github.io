00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140
Let's talk about some things to consider when using Redis and Base64.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.010
Redis has become so wildly popular in large part due to its performance.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.395
Redis can read and write very quickly.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:15.405
This makes it useful.

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:21.045
You might be wondering, how can I recognize when something is encoded in Base64 format?

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:26.230
Base64 encoding is always a string of letters that is meaningless at first glance.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.305
If you see a string of letters that doesn't spell anything intelligible,

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:33.125
you're probably looking at Base64.

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:37.700
Another telltale indicator is if the string ends with an equal sign.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:45.060
Last, try to decode it using a free online decoder, like base64decode.org.

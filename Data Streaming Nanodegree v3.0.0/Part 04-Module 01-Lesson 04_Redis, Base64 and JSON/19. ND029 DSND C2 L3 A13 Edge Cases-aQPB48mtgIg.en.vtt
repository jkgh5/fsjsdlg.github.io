00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.435
Let's discuss some potential edge cases.

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:08.265
What if you subscribe to the wrong Kafka topic in your Spark application?

00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:12.854
You may encounter this error after correcting the Kafka topic.

00:00:12.854 --> 00:00:16.470
The error states that some data may have been lost because,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.960
they are not available in Kafka anymore.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.420
In order to resolve this issue,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.380
in your Kafka connection within the Spark application,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.580
set the source option failOnDataLoss to false.

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:09.969
Here are the specs for an average machine that you could go out and buy today.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.080
There are several numbers to keep in mind,

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.660
but let's focus on four key components;

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.449
CPU, memory, storage, and network.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.509
Just in case you're unfamiliar with these hardware components,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.215
let's quickly define them.

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:25.980
The CPU is the central processing unit,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.824
it's the brain of your computer.

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:32.129
Every operation in your computer is eventually handled by your CPU.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.520
Memory, sometimes known as main memory or RAM,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.875
is a place to store data before it goes to your CPU.

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:40.429
You can think about it as

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:44.880
your computer scratch paper for helping with more complicated calculations.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.350
Storage, whether on a magnetic disk drive or

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.855
solid state drive is where all long-term data is kept.

00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:55.049
This is your computer's equivalent to a file cabinet.

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:58.320
Network is the connection to the outside world.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.329
This is how your computer can access anything that it doesn't have in storage.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.865
But there's a catch.

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:12.675
Most of the time, your CPU isn't processing data.

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:17.535
Instead, it's sitting idle as it waits for input data from your main memory.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:21.320
It takes about 250 times longer to find and

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.940
load a random byte from memory than to process that same byte with your CPU.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.429
In other words, and the time it takes to load

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.009
an hour's worth of random tweets from memory,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.910
a CPU could process over a week of tweets.

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:37.369
Fortunately, we usually organize the data in memory,

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:41.375
so it's lined up and ready for immediate processing by the CPU.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:43.924
By loading data sequentially, say,

00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:45.634
all the tweets for a single hour,

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:47.600
we can avoid this bottleneck.

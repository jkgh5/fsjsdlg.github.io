00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.140
Congratulations.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:10.504
You have completed the first lesson on Spark.

00:00:10.505 --> 00:00:14.130
In this lesson, we have discussed what we mean by big data,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.385
Spark's typical use cases,

00:00:16.385 --> 00:00:18.995
and you should, or shouldn't use Spark,

00:00:18.995 --> 00:00:21.144
and some tools surrounding Spark,

00:00:21.144 --> 00:00:23.245
in the big data ecosystem.

00:00:23.245 --> 00:00:28.539
If you would like to learn more about the topics and tools in the big data ecosystem,

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.739
check out the additional resources provided below.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.140
This course, we are focused on Spark,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.020
so we touched on the other tools only for your exposure.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.745
Now that you have a high-level understanding of the big data ecosystem, the next lesson,

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:46.399
we'll take a closer look at how to use Spark,

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.739
to solve real world big data problems.

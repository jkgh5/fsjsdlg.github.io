00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.035
While memory is efficient for feeding our CPU's data,

00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:14.060
we run into two problems.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.149
The first problem with memory is that it's ephemeral.

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:21.214
We'd lose all the data in our memory every time we shut down our machines.

00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:23.640
There simply isn't an option when you're holding onto

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.850
valuable data about your customers and business.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.820
Secondly, memory is expensive.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.804
So, most laptops only come with 8 gigs of memory.

00:00:32.804 --> 00:00:34.524
Back in the late 90s,

00:00:34.524 --> 00:00:37.109
when CPU speed starting to level off,

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.384
many companies invested in very expensive hardware with lots of memory.

00:00:41.384 --> 00:00:45.079
One of the key strategies that set Google apart was bypassing

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.354
this expense by building distributed systems using commodity hardware.

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:51.829
Rather than relying on lots of memory,

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.379
Google leveraged long-term storage on cheap pre-used hardware.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.270
Oh, and by the way,

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.640
if you didn't know a distributed system or cluster is

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.905
just a bunch of connected machines and these machines are usually called nodes.

00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:08.870
Also, when I mentioned commodity hardware,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.655
I'm talking about the computers that you and I would buy if we're on a tight budget.

00:01:13.655 --> 00:01:18.500
Using distributed clusters of commodity hardware has become the industry standard.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.299
Those are early systems at Google,

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.560
where the foundation for technologies like Spark.

To get a sense of the speed for each piece of hardware,

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:11.280
let's take a look at an example with Twitter data.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:16.399
On a typical day, the entire world generates about 6,000 tweets every second.

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:19.729
With each tweet coming in at around 200 bytes.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.594
This adds up to 1.2 million bytes or roughly 1 megabyte per second.

00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:30.015
The typical CPU can execute over 2.5 billion operations per second.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:34.265
This means that the CPU in your laptop can do a live character count

00:00:34.265 --> 00:00:38.954
on every tweet with over 99.9 percent of its time to spare.

00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:43.314
In fact, your computer probably has two CPUs, if it's a dual core.

00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:46.269
So, this would be no problem for a single machine.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.890
Distributed systems, distributed programming,

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.115
and distributed algorithms originally referred to computer networks,

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:18.300
where individual computers are physically distributed within

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.450
some geographical area and communicate with each other via message passing.

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.119
An early example from the 70s,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.394
is ARPANET's Email Application.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:30.073
In a network topology,

00:00:30.074 --> 00:00:31.600
which is basically a graph,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.039
each node has its own private memory and

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.494
processor and it communicates with the other nodes via messages.

00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:43.019
Some of you might have experienced with parallel computing using tools,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.330
such as OpenMP or OpenCL.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.570
You can think of parallel computing as

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.509
a particular tightly coupled form of distributed computing.

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:53.419
The main difference is,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.420
that in parallel computing all processors may

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.870
have access to a shared memory to exchange information.

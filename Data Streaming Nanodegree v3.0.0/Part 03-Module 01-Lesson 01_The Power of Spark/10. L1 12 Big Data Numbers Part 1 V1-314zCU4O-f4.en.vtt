00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.595
Over the next year,

00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:11.670
you and the rest of the Sparkify team work very hard to become

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:16.750
a worldwide success with millions of customers streaming music every day.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.919
With several of the content deals expiring soon,

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.830
the content team needs you to make the same report of

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.294
the most popular artists played by your Canadian users.

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:28.715
But after a year of stellar growth,

00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:32.575
the log of songs exploded to 200 gigabytes,

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:35.255
way beyond the four gigs that was last year.

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:37.380
So, what happens when you try using

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.020
the same Python program that worked so well the previous year?

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.755
When you run the program,

00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:45.290
which should read in records of song activity for

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.695
all users and spit out the artists for the Canadian users,

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:51.820
it seems to go well for a few seconds,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.844
but then your entire laptop seems to screech to a halt.

00:00:55.844 --> 00:00:58.384
The music you are listening to stops,

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:01.765
your Internet browser takes several seconds to load,

00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:04.954
and your mouse, which is now a spinning wheel,

00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:09.075
barely crawls across the screen as you drag it around.

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:11.195
After a few more minutes of this,

00:01:11.194 --> 00:01:13.909
you give up and kill the Python program,

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.200
which releases your system from this slow motion. What happened?

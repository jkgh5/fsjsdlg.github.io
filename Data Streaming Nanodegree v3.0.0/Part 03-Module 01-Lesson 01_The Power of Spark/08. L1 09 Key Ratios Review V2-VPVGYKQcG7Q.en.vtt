00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.699
By going through the Twitter example,

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.594
you're more familiar with the different aspects of hardware.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:13.915
Let's put all these numbers together.

00:00:13.914 --> 00:00:17.349
The fastest component of your hardware is the CPU,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.179
which is 200 times faster than loading data randomly from memory.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:27.245
Speaking of memory, it's about 15 times faster than long-term storage like SSDs.

00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:30.435
Finally, network is the worst bottleneck.

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:32.850
It's about 20 times slower to work with data,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.855
when you have to download it first.

00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:36.674
If you know these ratios,

00:00:36.674 --> 00:00:38.399
you'll know when you have big data,

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.729
and when to use a distributed technology like Spark.

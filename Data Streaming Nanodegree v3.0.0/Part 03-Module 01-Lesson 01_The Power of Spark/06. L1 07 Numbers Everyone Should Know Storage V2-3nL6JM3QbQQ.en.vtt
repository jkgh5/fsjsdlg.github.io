00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:10.259
While long-term storage like a hard drive disk is cheap and durable,

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.050
it's much slower than memory.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.490
Loading data from magnetic disk can be 200 times slower.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.780
Even the newer solid-state drives known as SSDs,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.964
are still about 15 times slower.

00:00:20.964 --> 00:00:24.870
For example, processing an hour of tweets from memory,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.355
would take about 30 milliseconds on my laptop.

00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:31.760
It will be closer to half a second if I had to load that data from my SSD storage,

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.054
or four seconds if I had an older magnetic hard drive.

00:00:35.054 --> 00:00:38.914
This difference between milliseconds and seconds may seem small,

00:00:38.914 --> 00:00:43.539
but once we're working with gigabytes or terabytes of data, it really adds up.

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:46.859
Luckily, we'll see that Spark was designed specifically,

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.130
to optimize our use of memory and avoid this problem.

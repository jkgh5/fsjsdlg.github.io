00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.585
Before we start using Spark,

00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:11.755
let's discuss how it fits into the greater Big Data environment.

00:00:11.755 --> 00:00:15.400
If you want to learn Big Data technologies and you do a quick search,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.605
you'll find dozens of different tools.

00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:22.324
It's hard to know where to start since there's practically a jungle of technologies.

00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:26.410
Like a jungle, these different tools form a complex ecosystem,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.230
each of them playing a different role in exchanging and

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.410
manipulating data using their unique strengths.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.679
These diverse technologies work together and in some cases,

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:39.700
compete to process and enrich data throughout its life-cycle.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.565
While every part of this ecosystem is important,

00:00:42.564 --> 00:00:45.769
there's one technology that plays an out-sized role.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.120
Spark is central to the Big Data ecosystem

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:53.049
and is the first tool you should learn if you want to work with Big Data.

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.024
In this sense, Spark is the king of the Big Data jungle.

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.859
In this lesson, we'll explore this ecosystem

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.439
by explaining what we mean when we say Big Data.

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:05.620
We'll go over how this environment developed and discuss how

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.655
Spark evolved as the leading framework for dealing with data at scale.

00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:12.700
We'll also discuss some of the cooperating technologies

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.885
that you use alongside Spark, like stream processing and databases.

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:21.010
Finally, we'll discuss some of the competing tools and the data food chain

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.870
and walk through their pros and cons, as compared to Spark

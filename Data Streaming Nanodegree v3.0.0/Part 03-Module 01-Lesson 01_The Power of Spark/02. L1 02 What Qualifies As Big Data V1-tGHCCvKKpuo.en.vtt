00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.960
Before you can understand the power of Spark,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.504
you need to understand how it fits into the context of big data.

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:15.580
Big data is an overloaded term with no single definition,

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.510
but most data scientists and engineers have a good sense of what we mean when we say,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.090
Spark is good for working with big data.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.949
For me, you know you're working with big data when instead of using a single machine,

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.324
it's easier to use a distributed system of multiple computers.

00:00:30.324 --> 00:00:33.189
Perhaps dozens or hundreds of servers that you wenr

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:36.674
from an Amazon data center than working on your own machine.

00:00:36.674 --> 00:00:39.759
To understand when our data becomes big data,

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:43.070
you need to be familiar with the capabilities of modern hardware.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.755
For example, how long does it take for your CPU to add two numbers?

00:00:47.755 --> 00:00:50.260
How quickly can you look up an appointment if

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:53.030
your calendar is already cached in your laptop's memory?

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.135
How many seconds does it take to load your favorite song from your laptop's SSD storage?

00:00:58.134 --> 00:01:01.614
How much data can you download from Netflix in a minute?

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:07.085
Knowing the rough answers to these type of questions is so critical that Peter Norvig,

00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:08.824
director of research at Google,

00:01:08.825 --> 00:01:11.299
has advised every programmer to learn them.

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.879
In fact, the data community often refers to them as the numbers everyone should know.

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:20.839
We'll explore these numbers now to give us context on big data,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.329
but these hardware concepts will show up throughout this course.

Your final solution should look something like this.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.420
You're going to show a Redis database.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.630
There will be a Redis data topic and

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.485
your application will be consuming that Redis data topic.

00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:18.195
You'll also be consuming other topics from the application,

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:24.880
and you'll be creating a topic that then gets fed back into the application.

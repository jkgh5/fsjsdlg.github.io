00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.490
So far, we've just scraped the surface of Kafka.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.720
Before we dive any further into how we can use Kafka for streaming applications,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.950
we need to better understand how it works so we can fully take advantage of it.

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:17.519
In this section, we'll cover Kafka's operational architecture,

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.364
how Kafka stores data,

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:22.109
Kafka high availability and data loss prevention with

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.230
data replication and Kafka data retention policies.

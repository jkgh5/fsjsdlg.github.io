00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.304
As you've seen, Kafka offers a number of configuration options for topics.

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.554
Remember, you can create topics automatically,

00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:08.589
but it's not a good practice to get into.

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.640
To get the best performance out of your Kafka cluster and it's topics,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.780
always make sure to manually create your topics with carefully considered options.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.009
One easy thing to consider in your producer applications is to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.730
write code that checks to see if the desired topic exists.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.990
If it doesn't exist,

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.500
then the producer can configure and create the topic.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.990
Alternatively, you can also consider using Bash scripts on

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.905
infrastructure provisioning tool like terraform to create your topics as well.

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:36.500
What you choose will ultimately be driven by

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.320
the workflows that you and your team are most comfortable with.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.960
Just remember, create topics manually.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.179
Don't rely on automatic topic creation.

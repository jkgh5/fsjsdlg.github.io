00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
Kafka is written in Scala and Java programming languages,

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.974
and by extension runs on the Java Virtual Machine.

00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:11.939
I'm going to refer to the Java Virtual Machine as the JVM for the rest of this class.

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.179
One of the wonderful things about the JVM is that the code

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.524
written against it can target so many different architectures.

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:21.254
Whether you prefer Linux, Windows,

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.939
macOS or some other operating system,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.755
Kafka will almost certainly run on your operating system because it was built on the JVM.

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:34.138
Additionally, the choice of the JVM has enabled the growth of a rich ecosystem of tools,

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:36.960
libraries and frameworks that integrate with Kafka.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.120
This has helped make Kafka pervasive in

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:42.879
the data industry where the JVM is a popular tool.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.209
Now that you've seen how to measure the performance of your Kafka consumers,

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:06.120
let's pivot and have a look at your Kafka producers.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.699
When your producer sends messages to the Kafka,

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:11.910
there's always some inherent latency in that process.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.394
Ideally though, that latency number is small and consistent.

00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:20.550
High latency can indicate that your acks setting is too high and that

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.825
too many ISR nodes must confirm message before returning.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:26.910
It may also indicate that

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.914
too many partitions or replicas have been assigned to this topic.

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:35.629
Another metric to keep your eyes on is the producer response rate.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.920
This metric is an indicator of how many messages are being delivered over time.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.570
You can measure these numbers by using

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.179
producer delivery callbacks in your client library.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.705
The simplest type of Kafka producer is the synchronous producer.

00:00:03.705 --> 00:00:07.304
Synchronous producers send data to Kafka and then block

00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:12.855
program execution until the message receipt has been confirmed by the Kafka broker.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:14.775
So when an action happens,

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:16.589
the producer emits an event,

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.059
and sends it to the broker.

00:00:18.059 --> 00:00:21.929
Broker then responds to the producer indicating that it has

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.280
correctly receive the event data from the producer.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.330
Once that's happened, the producer will continue execution.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.509
Synchronous production is fairly rare in the Kafka world,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.219
but it does have its place.

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.399
Imagine you're processing a credit card transaction and the application

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.699
requires a successful message delivery before moving on.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.340
In this scenario, it might matter a lot to the customer that

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.355
their data is definitely delivered and are in processing queue.

00:00:46.354 --> 00:00:50.854
In that case, we can use synchronous production to ensure that the delivery is a success.

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:53.569
Otherwise, we can roll back the transaction.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.270
Synchronous production is useful when you want to ensure

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.880
data is sent before moving the application forward.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.870
This type of producers should not be the default unless you have a good reason to use it.

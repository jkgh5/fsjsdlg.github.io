00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.804
You may recall that you can't easily delete records from Kafka,

00:00:05.804 --> 00:00:08.054
as it is an append only log.

00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:10.289
This is a serious issue in a world where

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:14.519
privacy regulations are increasingly giving consumers the right to be forgotten.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.355
Regulation like the EU's GDPR,

00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:20.655
and the California Consumer Privacy Act or CCPA,

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:25.095
grant citizens in these regions the right to request their data be removed from storage.

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:27.719
While it's an encouraging development that legislative bodies

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.464
have begun to take up this issue and protect consumers,

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:33.679
it does create some interesting technical challenges for Kafka users.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:39.325
In this section will review a strategy popularized by Kafka user Daniel Lebrero ,

00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:41.420
to allow for deletion of records and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.800
existing Kafka topics that belong to a user and contains sensitive information.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
All right. Welcome to the end of this lesson.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.919
We've learned a lot.

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:08.205
In this lesson, we've covered architecture,

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:11.530
consumer topic and producer configuration,

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:16.140
and learned best practices on how to monitor those same configuration items.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.324
We've also seen how to delete and manage and encrypt user data.

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:22.199
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.009
you have learned so much information about how Kafka works and you're going

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.105
to be ready to apply it not only in future lessons, but in the real world.

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:31.914
So now that we reviewed a lot today,

00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:34.399
but knowing this information is worth it and it's really

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.310
going to make this journey that much better for you.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.810
In the upcoming lesson,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.480
we're going to start seeing how we can really take

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:45.279
our Kafka data to the next level with data schemas.

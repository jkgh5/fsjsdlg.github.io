00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Remember that the data coming through the consumer is

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.160
serialized in some form from the producer.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.290
It's important to make sure you correctly

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.845
deserialize the data in your application, so that it's useful.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:14.730
For example, if the producer is serializing data to JSON,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.350
you'll also need to deserialize that JSON string into an object within the consumer.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.679
Failure to deserialize correctly can lead to crashes or

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.730
inconsistent data being fed to your downstream processing applications.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.469
This can be really tough to debug.

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:32.199
So it's best to think about it as you're writing your code the first time.

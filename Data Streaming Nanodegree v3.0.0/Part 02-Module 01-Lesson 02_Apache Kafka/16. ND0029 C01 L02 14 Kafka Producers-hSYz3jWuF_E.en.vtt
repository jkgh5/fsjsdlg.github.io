00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.615
Kafka producers are rich with options and configuration,

00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:08.150
similar to the Kafka topics you just learned about.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.554
In this section, we'll learn the ins and outs of creating Kafka producers.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.490
By the time we've completed this section,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.019
you will have mastered sending data to Kafka both synchronously and asynchronously.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.140
You'll also be familiar with fine-grained controls that

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.620
producers offer that help improve speed and serialized data.

It's worth understanding how Kafka stores data so that we can

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.570
better appreciate how the brokers achieved such high throughput.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.160
In fact, the way that Kafka stores data is almost disappointingly simple.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.469
Kafka simply has a data directory on disk where it stores a logged data and text files.

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:19.919
So here we have a directory /var/lib/kafka/data.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.635
This is where Kafka will sorts data in your workspace

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:25.770
as well as in many Kafka production systems.

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.480
Each topic receives its own sub-directory with the associated name of the topic.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.049
So here we have a sub-directory a and a sub-directory for topic

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:40.064
b. Kafka may store more than one log file for a given topic. Why is that?

00:00:40.064 --> 00:00:43.839
If Kafka were to use just one file to store the data for a given topic,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.435
it would be limited to the speed of a disk on which the broker is running.

00:00:47.435 --> 00:00:48.650
To help alleviate that,

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.259
Kafka can split data into many files.

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:53.210
You can control this when you create your topic

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.950
which we'll see how to do it in the next section.

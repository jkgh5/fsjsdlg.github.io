00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.209
In the previous, course we learned a ton about Kafka and now we'll

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:06.650
see how Spark Streaming can be easily integrated with Kafka,

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.464
and we'll explore this throughout this lesson.

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:11.469
Before we actually start integrating,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.730
I'd like to go over some useful classes and APIs we'll use in

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.685
this lesson and some sample code on how these are used.

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:21.509
We should be comfortable with integrating Kafka and

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.480
spark after exploring this classes and APIs.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.089
We'll also take a look at some architecture diagrams

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.699
at the end to go over generic business use cases.

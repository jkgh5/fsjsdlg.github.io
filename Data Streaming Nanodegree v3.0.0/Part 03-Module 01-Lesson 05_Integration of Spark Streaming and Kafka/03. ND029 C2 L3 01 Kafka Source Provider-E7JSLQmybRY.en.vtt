00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.294
In this concept, we'll go over intensely how to integrate Kafka and Spark streaming.

00:00:05.294 --> 00:00:10.109
We'll take a closer look at which Spark classes and API's that we'll be using.

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.980
Kafka source provider is the underlying class we'll use and it is

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.760
the provider for the streaming data source for Kafka source.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.599
Kafka source provider requires these options; subscribe,

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.190
subscribepattern, or assign, and Kafka.bootstrap.server.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.290
This sounds difficult in words,

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.784
but in code it's simply format of Kafka and subscribing to a topic name here,

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:38.309
and subscribing to a Bootstrap server, usually,

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.179
we'll be using for localhost and a port number for the topic.

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.869
Kafka source providers sets the properties for Kafka consumers and executors.

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:49.875
This is why we don't create separate consumer modules for

00:00:49.875 --> 00:00:54.179
Kafka producer when we integrate Kafka and Spark.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Congratulations. We've successfully learned

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.115
about Spark Streaming and Structured Steaming.

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:07.830
Also, we saw how we can integrate Kafka,

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.160
which is one of the most popular choices of data ingestion for

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.810
Spark Structured Streaming and created a simple data ingestion pipeline.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.420
We also looked at some general ideas how you

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.010
can implement these in your business use cases,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.520
so you can apply the things we learned at your job.

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.039
I hope you enjoyed the experience and hope to see you again.

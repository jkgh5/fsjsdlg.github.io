00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.889
Hopping windows have both a duration and an increment by which they are advanced.

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:07.500
If we were to define a hopping window of 10 minutes in

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.830
duration and an increment time of one minute,

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.530
every one minute the window would be advanced forward.

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.335
So let's visualize that again.

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:19.394
So if I have Window 1 here,

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:25.199
I'm going to have some overlap which is our increment with Window 2.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.939
Window 3 will have some overlap with Window 2 and so on.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.289
So we can't have overlapping windows and it's

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.490
also possible although we don't show it on the slide that I increment is too large,

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.920
we may actually have gaps between the windows as well.

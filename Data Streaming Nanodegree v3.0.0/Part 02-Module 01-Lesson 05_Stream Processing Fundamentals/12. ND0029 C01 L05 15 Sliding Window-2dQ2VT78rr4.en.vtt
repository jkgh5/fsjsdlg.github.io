00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Sliding windows operate nearly identically to

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.205
hopping windows with one important difference.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.665
Sliding windows don't have an increment period.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:10.199
They simply increase on a very fast basis,

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.524
typically a basis measured in seconds.

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:14.400
So let's see what this looks like.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.594
As you can see, the window simply slides along,

00:00:17.594 --> 00:00:21.419
and as time progresses so too does our window.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.020
In practice, this means that a sliding window always contains

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.844
the most up-to-date representation of a defined time period possible.

00:00:28.844 --> 00:00:31.994
Sliding windows are overlapping and typically gapless.

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:34.170
Again, because the window is sliding,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.140
there is no opportunity for there to be a gap between windows.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
The first type of windowing we'll discuss is the tumbling window.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.080
A tumbling window is a fixed period of time that

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.500
rolls over after that first fixed window has ended.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.015
Tumbling windows don't overlap and there's never a gap between the windows.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.219
Let's see an example of this.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:19.439
Lets say we define a tumbling window of

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.310
15 minutes and started running [inaudible] application right now.

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:27.539
Each 15 minute time window will identify a series of events,

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.984
and aggregate those events during a time period.

00:00:29.984 --> 00:00:31.524
When that time we know ends,

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:33.979
all the data is evicted from the window and we're

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:37.265
just left with what's in an upcoming newest window.

00:00:37.265 --> 00:00:40.160
One more thing I just want to point out before I move on,

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:42.784
since we have this visualization in front of us,

00:00:42.784 --> 00:00:46.849
you can see for each one of these windows that they butt up against each other,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.454
but they don't overlap.

00:00:48.454 --> 00:00:52.589
So events from window 1 will not be present in window 2,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.595
and events from window 2 will not be present in window 3 and so on.

00:00:56.594 --> 00:00:58.509
So just keep that in mind,

00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:03.059
these windows don't overlap and there is no gap between them.

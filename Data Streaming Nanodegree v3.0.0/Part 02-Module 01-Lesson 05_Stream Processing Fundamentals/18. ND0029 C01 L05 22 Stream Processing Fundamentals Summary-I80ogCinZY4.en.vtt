00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.544
In this section, we reviewed common concepts amongst all stream processing applications.

00:00:07.544 --> 00:00:10.410
You learned about common strategies and how to interact with streaming

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.710
data such as filters, joins, and aggregates.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.660
We also saw how windowing works,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.359
and when you would use the different types of windowing.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.719
We also learned about streaming applications and how they maintain

00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:25.859
state with Kafka and local state source such as RocksDB.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.100
With all this conceptual information under our belt,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.460
we're ready to move on to the upcoming lessons and put these skills to work.

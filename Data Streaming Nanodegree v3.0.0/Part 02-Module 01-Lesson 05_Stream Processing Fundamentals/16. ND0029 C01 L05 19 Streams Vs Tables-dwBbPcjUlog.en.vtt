00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
It's common first learning about streams and

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.629
tables to think of them in opposition to each other.

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:07.154
It's true that they do in fact satisfy

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:10.349
different types of problems and give us different type of data,

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.509
but they're not in opposition to each other.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.115
In fact, they're complimentary.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:16.844
When we talk about a stream or we talk about a table,

00:00:16.844 --> 00:00:20.265
what we're really describing is the expected output of our streaming application.

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:23.175
It's a way of describing how we expect to convey meaning

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:26.850
from the action our stream processing application is performing.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.330
Streams describe applications that are transforming or filtering

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.259
input data into an unending sequence of immutable events.

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:36.679
Tables describe applications that are creating

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:41.494
a roll up point-in-time view that is continually updated as new data is generated.

00:00:41.494 --> 00:00:43.909
Many stream processing frameworks will ask you to

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.625
choose between a stream or a table type,

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:49.280
but what you're really being asked to choose between is

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.800
the expected output type of your application.

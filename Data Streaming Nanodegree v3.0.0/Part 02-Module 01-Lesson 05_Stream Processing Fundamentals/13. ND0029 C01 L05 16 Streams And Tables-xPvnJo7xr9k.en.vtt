00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.375
One of the most confusing terminology issues to stream processing newcomers is

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:10.365
understanding the difference between a stream processing stream,

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:12.285
and a stream processing table.

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:14.115
I'm just going to refer to them as a Stream,

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:15.675
and Table from here on out.

00:00:15.675 --> 00:00:18.480
We'll cover the differences in depth in this section,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.745
but the key difference is that a Table imply state and aggregation of some kind whereas

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:29.250
a Stream is a never ending immutable series of ordered events.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.435
Let's just repeat that. Table is an aggregated view,

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:36.825
and a Stream is a never ending series of events.

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:40.245
Both Streams and Tables are important to stream processing application.

00:00:40.244 --> 00:00:43.059
So let's learn more about how they're used
